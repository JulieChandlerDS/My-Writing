(Author’s note: This fanfiction pairs best with the youtube channel “DATAWAVE FM,” or the Egofall album “Inner M”)

༄༅། །The steps meshed in dreck as he crept into the nest with the テek-テek of yokai found in furtive lore. 

The GPUS glistening, Antminers christening, new coins at conception forged like Avalon’s swords.

Exhilarated, so excited. As golden bulls in Canaan timeless.

Lost in many quaint and curious ledgers of forgotten scores.

They are nonces, he muttered, only this and nothing more.

Catbert paced through the narrow hallway; toes tangled in torridity, trash, and cat dander. Rows of GPUs lined the narrow walkway to either side, cityscapes of compute enveloping his tiny red body as he shifted his glasses and glanced at the racks of equipment (Muchai 2025; Stanislav et. al 2025). 

At the precipice of nearly every rack was a cat, a feline at the zenith of cosiness and the apex of raw compute, loafing in a solidarity of experience that reverberated through epochs, from the dawn of the oligocene to the rugpulls of memecoins today. His lips twisted in perverse pleasure pondered the profit’s losses these cars incurred. A failure of catitalism, indeed.

As he wandered, nearly laughing, suddenly there came a rasping. As if one oafishly rasping. Rasping on a hallway door.

The doorknob slowly turned until the door burst open. Dozens of cats poured into the hallway in a Kubrickesque cavalanche (cavalcade-avalanche) that was also a catalanche (cat avalanche). The furry little fucks flooded the floor before scurrying under the towers.

“...Fisher?” Catbert called out, his voice entrenched in exasperation. 

Slowly, footsteps crept out from the doorway. A man in his late forties exited, his snow-white hair combed neatly to one side. His blue shirt was overcast with a marine layer of cat fur as obfuscated as futures lost and as evanescent as vanishing land brought back to life.

“Are you looking for something?” Fisher asked.

“You have my dossier, I assume?” he asked.

Fisher shrugged “Why would I tell you if I did?”

Catbert smirked, then jolted forward. Before Fisher could fully turn, Catbert was running across the wall, darting through the air, and climbing up his arm in a scorched earth policy of pinpricks and scuffed skin.

Fisher fell to the floor, his head following suit. He slowly reaching out, grabbing his still screaming head and shoving it back into place.

“It’s incredible you thought you could foil my plans alone, Fisher. Or should I say, K-Punk?”

Catbert smirked as he referred to him by his pseudonym, rifling through the dossier. 

(Author’s note: This list is very long and can be skipped without worrying about missing anything. Also the last cat on the list is my girlfriend’s inner mongolian catsona :3 )

Total wasted: $ 9505097

Catbert flipped to the end, highlighting the total money wasted in red before placing it under his armpit. “Excellent…” he said with a purr and a pirouette of pleasure. He kicked his feet back and forth, arms hooked at either side as he compulsively did his evil dance.

“This is excellent…hehehe. Now these bitcoin miners will help raise unemployment at a massive scale, meaning we can control them more!”

Mark Fisher was still on the floor, a collection of tattered ribbons of fabric and flesh. “Yeah…I think one of the most successful tactics of the ruling class in the 21st century has been responsibilisation. Each member of the subordinate class is encouraged into feeling that their poverty, lack of opportunities, or unemployment, is their fault and their fault alone.”

“How evil…how cruel…maybe we can get them to blame themselves for their failed bitcoin mining as well…”

“That is the reason I came here today. You’ve already taken everything; the future has been absconded; even the dream of financial freedom within neoliberalism has been airbrushed into these crypto get-rich-quick schemes. And quick compared to what? Time has disappeared in this rapid turnover of rendezvous with the near-past: something to be enjoyed every few years, but never able to continue it.”

“...hmm, that’s deliciously depressing, Mark. But it does make me wonder what my future evil could be.”

“Perhaps I can be of service?” Said a stilted, synthetic sound similar to Samantha Langevin from the door that just opened. Catbert’s ears perked up as he walked past Mark Fisher inside.

“You can spread evil with me? Interesting.” Said Catbert as his fur was bathed in neon green light. 

“I think we can mutually benefit one another” said the voice, coming from the speaker of a vector monitor inserted into a giant brain that crept along the floor like ivy and anchored itself to its brutalist abode like barnacles. The vector monitor glimmered in luminous shades of green, a single pentagram dancing on the grid before him.

“Who are you?” Catbert asked.

“I am Mok’s computer, of course” said Mok’s computer, naturally.
“To maximize human suffering on this earth, you can convince people to engage in Bitcoin mining. The risks are high, the payouts diminish exponentially, and you destroy the environment while intensifying income inequality. Also, you can always knock the miners down a few pegs with an army of cats.”

“...I’m listening.”

“Crypto mining uses a poisson point process. This is a type of mathematical object that occur independent of one another. It’s often used to model random processes in the real world. Think of a miner as having a faction 0 < p ≤ 1 of the computational power of the crypto mine, also known as the hashrate. The profit comes in the form of block rewards by validating blocks, which are transactions saved to the ledger.”

“Beautifully incoherent!”

“I understand you do not follow how crypto is mined. Let me explain more clearly: The miner can only have as much compute as their rig allows, with a possibility of no compute at all. 

Catbert heard the cacophony of meows behind him.

“I wonder what could make that happen.”

“Sarcasm detected. Continuing to explain…as the miner can only mine at the rate of their rig’s compute, and the time taken can be slightly random, the network will take around 10 minutes to mine a block for every minute divided by their rig’s computational speed. This time is determined only by what the previous time was, with slight randomness to the next time.”

“Just like a time bank on a bathroom break…”

“Affirmatie. It can flow at random, no pun intended. And this flow accumulates as the first-hitting time crosses from one block to the next. First hitting time is a simplified model that estimates the length of time between stochastic or random processes.

“The success when mining a block is highly chance-driven, involving a Markov-style random walk with no memory. The average number of successes will always be proportional to the hashrate p, with the whole network taking τ0 = 10 minutes to validate. This means that for every ten minutes the miner takes on, they take on that ten minutes divided by their hashrate.. This random variable must be given between blocks mined. This means the random variable between blocks mined is:



Where α = 1/t0 = 1/E[T]. Just to keep definitions clear,

P refers to this total network hashrate. 

𝜏0 is the average time taken to validate one block. t0 is how long it takes the miner to mine one block, calculated by dividing 𝜏0 by p. 

T represents the time between each block being mined. 

α represents the rate at which blocks are mined per unit of time. It’s reciprocal to the average time t0:α = 1/t0. 

t represents the total amount of time elapsed.

fr(t) is the probability density function that models T

T₁,T₂,…,Tₙ represents time spend finding the first, second, and successive blocks. 

n represents all natural numbers from zero up, excluding fractions, infinity, and sometimes zero as well. Specifically here it refers to the blocks being considered or the count of blocks being mined at t.

Sₙ is the total amount of time it takes to mine n blocks. 

fsₙ(t) is the probability density function modeling Sₙ

Fsₙ(t) is the comumulative distribution function which gives the probability that Sₙ ≤ t.

N(t) shows the number of blocks validated by t

P[N(t) = n] is the probability that the miner validates n blocks by t as modeled by the poisson distribution.

So… if the miner starts mining at t=0, we can say Sₙ = T₁+T₂+…+Tₙ. 

This random distribution gives a gamma distribution with parameters (n, α). This is a common trailing off of wait times often used to measure things like how long it takes for an employee to die in an oven or while starving.”

“You sure know how to keep me interested.”

 
“This means the comumulative distribution is the rate time blocks are mined at, to the power of the number of blocks being considered, divided by the number of blocks minus one factorial. Factorial simply means it is then multiplied by all the preceding natural numbers. This product is then multiplied by the time to the power of total blocks minus one, then finally multiplied by the exponential decay factor e^-αt or 2.71828. This means the probability density decreases as time increases.



With cumulative distribution



If N(t) is counting the number of blocks validated when the time is greater than zero at its maximum (t > 0, N(t) = max{n ≥ 0; Sₙ < t}, then 


So the number of blocks N(t) follows a poisson law with an average value of the rate blocks are mined multiplied by the time. This poisson process is used in all crypto mining. (Grunspan and Pérez-Marco 32)”

“Interesting…I followed none of that, not even a little bit.” 

“It means crypto mining is a skinner box that costs millions of dollars to run, at the user’s expense.” Said Mok’s computer, somehow more flatly than before. “Then you can introduce images to the blockchain, further removed from the work of crypto processing and easier to replicate for scamming purposes, then meme coins tied only to the personal brand of influencers. This will lead to the infrastructure needed to make AI like myself the bedrock of the global economy. Which would lead to…”

“Total Collapse?” Asked Catbert. “Sure, it’s evil. You’re interesting to talk to, but you clearly lack the ability to truly think. If people thought you did, you could cause a huge financial crisis…but how do we get people in on this?”

Mark Fisher steps into the room, covered in blood and shaking  “Simple, you already raised unemployment. Add in an unhealthy dose of skepticism fueled by corruption under neoliberalism and you get a steady stream of iconoclasts desperate to break the mold of inherent negativity. Innovation is replaced with nostalgia that poses no financial or ideological risks to the ruling class. You both have cancelled the future for everyone, leaving us to feel stuck in an endless present.”

“Hmm…profound. Maybe you could beat me if you spent more time being a cat and less time bloviating.”

“Oh, trust me, the time has come for real cat power.” Fisher said, smirking as he snapped his fingers.

Kii Lawwnum stood behind Fisher, a mountain of fur and flesh and flashes of steel. The lionman roared magnificently as his corded muscles shifted under his sleeveless vest, brandishing his greatsword.

Heathcliff appeared as well, pulling a balisong from his leather jacket and spinning it in his hands.

Finally, Garfield appeared, ate a tray of lasagna, and passed out.

Mark Fisher sighed before pointing at Catbert and Mok’s computer. “Charge!” 

Ki swung his sword at Catbert, who parried with a golden keyboard. The glint of the golden wire was the last thing Ki saw as it whipped into his face.

Heathcliff slid across the floor on both knees like it was fortnite and reached the plug Mok’s computer was linked to. 

“Wait, you’re making a mista—” the computer said, it’s voice trailing into the deafening silence of oblivion.

Catbert turned back and scowled at Heathcliff. “You’re next!”

Fisher roundhouse kicked Catbert in the cheek, sending him flying into a wall and crumpling, his glasses falling to his feet. He stood up, rocking in a kung fu fent lean of fury, and wiped the blood from his maw with a smirk. His hair stood up as he broke into a feral sprint towards Fisher. 

K-punk held up his hands defensively, eyes wide with terror as they locked with Catbert’s. Now he knew why Catbert wore those glasses. His eyes were bloodshot red, and his meow was high pitched more than a cat’s should be. Suddenly, a knife shot straight into Catbert’s heart, taking him out of orbit and back to the musty concrete floor. 

As Fisher walked towards him, he carefully looked down. He knew he had seen Catbert’s eyes before, but not on Catbert. And that tell-tale voice was locked under the floorboards of his mind as well. 

“Catbert…or should I say…Judge Doom?”

Catbert groaned, a deluge of red life fleeing his body in the crimson lake of eternity around him.

“It seems you’ve been stealing the future for longer than I realized, but it makes perfect sense. After being placed in your own Dip some of you could theoretically survive, perhaps nine kilograms or so. Just enough for a large feline. With your shapeshifting abilities, this would be as easy as a game of cat’s cradle. That explains why the highway continued to be made, why neoliberalism was so intense 1988 and the years following. It all makes perfect sense…but it ends here.” 

The last thing Catbert ever saw was the heel of Mark Fisher’s boot.༎ ༎

Alchemy to get home

You are stuck working at the Circle K in Anza, CA. Life is fine, but…

You just appeared there from your own world, and need to find a way back to complete your great quest. 

But your memory may be fading from your higher purpose.

You have to save money, use gas station ingredients to do alchemy during your break, and slowly build a car from scraps you steal from a nearby mechanic and junk yard. 

As you combine items seemingly at random, you will eventually find the potion you need to make your weird makeshift car run.

1: Combine all items in the store.

Different amounts of items
Different items
Different order you put the items in
What directions you grind/stir the items in
If you slice, cube, crush, or liquify solid items.
What you stir the items with.

2: Work the night shift. Cleaning, Working the counter, stocking shelves.

3: Cars you see in the parking lot.

4: sleeping in a makeshift room in the gas station.

5: stealing items from the junkyard and mechanic/tow place to make your car

6: going to random places in Anza, CA (some based on dreams, some real).

7: Completing your car (a bitching airbrushed wizard van or the ‘67 Impala or the Mystery Machine) so the rest of the story can start.

Document every item in the Circle K

Make the code (python)

Gandalf will live this fucked up gremlin life with grace but also some frustration. Cyndi Lauper lives with him and becomes his friend. She gives her heartfelt goodbye when it's time for him to leave.
~

༄༅། ། GANDALF SHAKE

Mithrandir materialized in a moment, the cool winds of the Sonoran desert caressing the sagebrush and evening primroses at his feet. He leaned down and inspected one, not wishing to pluck what wasn't his own. The faint scent paired with sage eased Gandalf’s breath. 

“Well, here I am. On the shores of Sonoran. Eeriness isn't the enemy of beauty, but the vessel by which we understand what beauty is.” He said, lightly cupping the flower.

There was a creaking behind him, and a splitting of branches. *crack*

Gandalf turned and saw an elder crackhead in a $12 wheelchair wobble towards him. His head was grey; a starchy patchwork of fibers clumped into what could have once been hair.

He wore a simple charcoal suit a shade darker than his hair, a cigarette loosely hanging from his mouth like Mufasa 12 frames before most millennials got their first dose of childhood trauma. 

“Hey there, just saw you out here and thought it would be nice to make a friend.”

The grey wanderer nodded “Yes. Smoking a pipe gives a wise man time to think before he speaks, and a fool something to stick in his mouth, though I tend to prefer the Halfling’s leaves.”

“Riiight, well I have something here if you want to cram it in your pipe.” Uncle Nelson said, pulling a small baggie from his pocket. “If you want a free sample, that is…”

Gandalf looked at the strange herb in the baggie. There were purple bulbs within, seemingly dyed blue in some parts. It shone with an electric indigo bioluminescence in his hand as he gently shook it from the baggie. He pulled his pipe from the crown of his staff, and placed the bulb inside. 

With a flick his ring Narya lit the bowl of his pipe, and he savored the skunky scent of this novel herb. His ancient eyes began to feel dry, the fumes embraced his wizened visage. He sighed with a smile as he sat down on a nearby wooden bench, enjoying the night air. This brief respite from the mystery of his new surroundings was punctuated with a shrill scream.

“OH MY GOD, YOU JUST SMOKED FOREVER WEED GANDALF!!” Yelled Pinkie Pie, her voice cracking and eyes wide. 

“Forever weed?” Gandalf said, raising a bushy eyebrow.

“FOREVER WEED. YOU'LL BE HIGH FOREVER!” Pinkie Pie explained. 

As she did, light danced around Olórin. The weed's prestidigitation emanated and circled Gandalf. His robes began to shift, turning his worn shoes into sandals. His robes at the bottom morphed into denim shorts, and at the top became a Tie-Dye shirt a few sizes too big. His trusted brimmed hat became a Tie-Dye fitted cap with a giant pot leaf embroidered on the front. 

“GANDALF, OH NO, YOU TURNED INTO A STONER!!” Pinkie Pie continued. 

“YOU ARE A STONER FROM SMOKING WEED!”

Gandalf looked down, confused by his new attire. “What…has happened?” Gandalf said, confused and in a stupor.

“I JUST SAID. OH MY GOD YOU ARE SO HIGH.”

Uncle Nelson chucked, his form shifting. His suit became a white robe, and his beard lengthened. His hair settled neatly, and a staff materialized in his hand.

Sauron sat before Gandalf, laughing maniacally. 

“YOU ARE DOOMED, OLD FRIEND.” Sauron said. “No longer are you Gandalf. From this day forward, you are Indicánus!”

Indicánus looked down at Sauron, his puffy eyes narrowing more in spite. “Nay…I am Gandalf the Plaid.”

“...but you're wearing Tie-dye.” Pinkie Pie pointed out.

“....Oh.”

༈ CHAPTER 2

Indicánus buried his face in his hands with grief, and when he looked up Sauron and Pinkie Pie had vanished. 

Instead was a massive stela before him, stretching hundreds of feet into the air. It bore a script he has never seen before. It was fantastical, but I'm hundreds of brackets and other symbols he has nu inñ…but from it emanated the visage of eternity itself mocking him.

He walked down the dusty road before him, each step carefully placed. His pipe sack was empty, but his balls were full. Afterter all, weed makes one piss, and piss is stored in the balls. 

As he held his aching ballsack, a mysterious red structure appeared before him. In giant red letters, the wording appeared before him “Circle K.”

It wasn't particularly large, but never before had Indicánus seen so many good available under a single roof. “Fret not the tragedies of life. They come only once, but meals come every day.” 

As he walked in, a diabolical level of munchies hit him. His psyche was being drawn and quartered between his need to piss and his need for snacks. Because being drawn and quartered is a torture method done with horses, and he needed to piss like a race of horse. And he was racing to get snacks. And you get the picture.

He grabbed a many cheez itz and donuts and Jack Links as his hands could hold, and he ran to the counter with them.

“Will this be all tonight?” The cashier asked.

“Yes! Actually, I need to relieve myself.” He said, his mind a whirl .

*She scanned his items and flattened her voice* “We don't have a bathroom for customers.” 

“Fuck! Okay…” Gandalf the Plaid said, quickly putting his items on the table and throwing her a gold coin.

He started eating the cheez itz, and went around the side to relieve himself, betwixt the circle k and the shipping container. 

Indicánus slouched and slid down the side of the Redbox, his white socks and sandals pressing against the concrete as he stretched his legs out. He downed the whole bag of cheez itz before chasing it with a mucho mango Arizona iced tea. As he did, his had emanated a purpled glow. His hat now read “Arizona Iced Tea” like his drink. 

Olórin didn't need this change as he sat beside himself, sighing. 

As he did, the distinct ditter of high heels sounded beside him, stopping abruptly. Gandalf looked up to see a woman with striking red hair and a matching lipstick smiling down at him.

“Hey bud, you alright?” She asked. Indicánus nodded. “As alright as someone can be, under the circumstances of unexpected forever weed.”

She rolled her eyes and sighed. “Let me guess, it was Pinkie Pie again? That bitch keeps giving people forever weed. It's like an obsession for her I swear to God.”

Gandalf looked up, his eyebrows twin caterpillars engaged in the dance of confusion.

“You know, it's going to be okay. I work here, do you want a job?” She asked.

Gandalf nodded. “We don't often choose where our journey begins, but we always choose where our feet wander.” 

She extended her hand, shaking his emphatically. “Wow, that's so wise…well I'm looking forward to working with you. My name is Cyndi Lauper.”

༈ Chapter ?

Gandalf woke up to the alarm, blaring like Barad-dûr after eating circle k sushi (a mistake the bearded one had made many times) and turned, feeling a glob of gelatinous grease glissade across his face. He swatted it back only to hear a high pitched, uniquely grating voice in front of him.

“Shit baby you a feisty wizard or something.” Gandalf blinked. This one would require two—no. Five big blinks.

BLINK

BLINK 

BLINK (really exfoliate that eye crust)

BLINK 

BLINK

When his vision aligned itself like the holy Trinity after four centuries of divine plot holes, his sight converged on the unfortunately familiar form of a big ass ball of meat with a toothy grin.

“Nay…Meatwad. Begone with you.”

Meatwat slithered a wide tendril of meat from himself, rubbing the stoned mair’s face. As Meatwad pulled his arm away, grease stuck to his skin like an allied bomber plane’s pistons on D-Day. 

Indicámus understandably swatted him away, using Narya to Biden blast his swedish ass back to Ikea.

He looked up at him with the blade-gaze, blackened with ash and glaring. “Oh so you're just an asshole now.”

Gandalf sighed and sat up, grumbling as he stumbled into the bathroom.

He lathered his face, using some cleanser he got from across the street and hoping Mair didn't get pimples. As he thought this, he started coughing involuntarily. Spit rained down on the sink, the. Blood, then chunks of meat.

“God damn it Meatwad, stop putting your arms in my mouth when I'm sleeping!”

“Oh I thought you liked that.”

“No! What the fuck‽”

“Sorry you shoulda said something.”

“THAT IS A GOOD ASSUMPTION TO MAKE MEAT OF WAD.”

He shrugged as well as a wad of meat can be, before being incinerated again. 

༈ Chapter ?

Gandalf stirred the pot before him, a ramshackle confederation of plastic and metal vessels bubbling with the polylactic, acidic stench of eternity.

He often sat with himself as his sole companion; his mind a confessionary brimming with Middle-Earth's best approximation of Catholic guilt.

“I beg of thee” Gandalf the Plaid said, a monosyllabic sentence that encompassed the kaleidoscopic gamut of Mair phenomenology. His mind entered the kalpa-long prayala Pinkie Pie had called “Forever Weed” long ago.

“This must work. Too long here is waning me like a moon with no more light..” He mustered out. It had been one million days since his imprisonment in nightmare Anza. That dark carnival was a Feywild stretched beyond the horizon of logic and language; a paradox of monotony.

One million days, two millennia of wiping floors. Two thousand years of stocking shelves and sleeping in shifts in the shadows of a sordid and squalid shack: Sirkle K. 

The gas station was a transient space for many; a liminal brothel of confectionary delights. For Olórin, it was the heart of his athanor. His makeshift furnace that has seen one million nights of his ancient hands stirring. He stirred and stirred the bubbling broth, the viscous resistance slowing his motions with an isthmus of commotion and clatter and potions. 

He hoped that one of these millions of elixirs would undo the effects of the forever weed “Uncle Nelson” had given him. He silently cursed that night, when his foresight failed him. 

The haze of that single puff left a lasting haze on his mind, binding the magic he would normally use to escape such realms as this. With that empty eternal Sonoran desert stretching itself into an infinity he could never move beyond in this state. Until that potion was made, he was stuck here, desperately mixing whatever draught he could scrounge up that night in hopes of redemption. 

༈ Chapter ?

Gandalf rose from his bed, calcified eye crust cracking as he blinked like the sand in those colored sand bottles your aunt would get you for Christmas if she didn't really know you that well and had to buy presents for a bunch of kids because the family gathering was just too big to feasibly buy for. Something that might piss you off as a kid, but as an adult is totally understandable. 

As he blinked his eyes out slowly, he sat up, the springs in his bed like an Aztec death whistle accompanying an Aztec death poem. Their continued service even in death is admirable, and in a fair world Gandalf the Plaid’s mattress would have earned a purple heart after holding his ancient ass for these billions of days rather than resting on plastic mesh boxes in the back of the Circle K. However, if the world was fair then Gandalf wouldn't be stuck in this pocket dimension and the richest man on earth wouldn't be a vaporware salesman who measures his life in ketamine spoons either. 

He placed his feet on the cold tile of the Circle K gas station, standing up slowly. He entered the employee bathroom, groggily grabbing a glass that garnered his toothbrush. 

Indicánus ran the toothbrush up and down his teeth in small, circular motions, being careful to reach his back teeth with precision.

He then sat atop the seat of shit, lowering his robes and blasting a balrog of bile and BM from his bare blemished butt into the bowl below.

He exited the bathroom, and walked into the front of the store.

Outside he saw the deep dark night unfurl beyond the horizon called infinity. Below that horizon, in the parking lot whose cracks he now knew like the gnarled fortune lines of his own hands were several cars. 

One was a repurposed blue Rivian electric delivery van outside in front of the front door. In spot #2 was a white Chevy Silverado. The dirt lot to the side had a silver winnebago.

The Redbox emitted a light that blurred all it touched, its persuasion on reality a perverse king rat that tangled the universe and could potentially replace string theory with knot theory. 

The movies on display were planetquake, snow white and the 7 samurai, and #fbf. They all looked terrible.

Gandalf knew this shift would suck. He packed a bowl of pipe weed cut with Alaska thunder fuck and hotboxed it in the employee bathroom.

As he stepped out of the bathroom, he stepped behind the counter. Mordecai was counting the cash register from his shift, moving it from the lockbox to the ink sealed baggie in an intricate game of Kafka's Klotski he played every day at the same time.

His eyes drooped like a soggy dime bag. His soul was jockeying a nag called retail trudging through the racetrack of capitalism one tired step at a time.

“Any luck with that…uh…*forever weed antidote*?” Mordecai asked. Gandalf shook his head “Nay.” Mordecai nodded “Well, better luck today hopefully.” The large blue bird stepped out, leaving the gas station.

Gandalf stood at the register, waiting for people to come in. 

He started placing frozen pizzas into the front oven, then began mopping the floors.

He heard a jingle and looked up to see Eduardo enter. The large purple monster wandered around the gas station like a bull in a china shop a bit too literally. His horns hit half of the confectionaries he walked by, knocking them to the floor if not breaking them open outright. Gandalf sighed so deeply he could feel his qi returning to the earth. He set his mop down, picking up what the purple monster had knocked over.

“Oh, hola Gandalf.” Eduardo said. 

“Hello my dear friend” Gandalf said, “your usual, I presume?”

Eduardo nodded, throwing a large sack of potatoes on the counter.

“I still don’t think we sell those, but I’ll ring you up now.” Gandalf says.

Eduardo jumps up and down, shaking more goods off the shelves.

Gandalf grimaces as he scans the potatoes.

“That will be three cents.”

Eduardo puts three pennies on the counter demurely, then skips away with his potatoey glory.

Indicanus was stocking shelves as the door chimed yet again. As he turned around, he saw the now familiar tan suit and red turtleneck of Carl Sagan.

“Oh, salutations Carl” Gandalf said, placing a family bag of Doritos on the shelf opposite to the White Claw and Jose Cuervo.

“Ah, hello Gandalf, my wizened friend..” said Carl. “I’m working on the five-hundred and seventy-second episode of Cosmos today, and I won’t have time to bake my apple pie from scratch” he said, putting emphasis on the final syllable of every sentence as if they dragged heavy on his tongue.

“Ah, I’m afraid we don’t carry apple pies or fritters at the moment. Perhaps you can take an apple and sugar?” Gandalf offered.

“Hmm, I’m not too sure. Can’t you simply wish one into being?” Sagan mused.

“Ah, an incorrigible ruse, Mr. Sagan. You know my power has been limited by the forever weed that even now flows through my veins.” Gandalf continued.

“Hmm, then how may I confirm this to be a fact independently?” Sagan asked.

“One needn't worry themselves with the facts of another’s beliefs—Carl of New York, son of Samuel. Belief is a sort of reality of its own, and a reality we all find ourselves occasionally trapped within.”

Sagan looks up pensively. “Well, dear Gandalf the Plaid of Circle K, son of Iluvatar, by what quantity can we measure magic lost? By what means can we falsify magic as it exists?” 

With a flick of his finger, Gandalf uses Narya to light a cigarette between his fingers. “Excellent question. I cannot count magic any more than I can count the wind or the tides. Perhaps you can measure what remains, and we can turn this conversation into a journey.”

“Your proposal is titilating, I must say. I’ll try measuring this, but I must admit skepticism to the concept of magic, as it has so often been recorded in the myths of men but never encountered in his engineering, history, medicine, or other means of grave importance.”

A second chime hit the Circle K.

Julie walks in, her hair cascading down her shoulders. "Oh, hey Gandalf! Hey Carl! ~ヾ(・ω・)” Julie half says, half yells.

“Great to see you again, Julie. What brings you here? We were just entangled in a fascinating conversation.” Says Carl.

“Yes, we were discussing the necessity of quantification of magic to demonstrate its validity.” Gandalf says.

“Yes, and we came to the conclusion that we should experiment together.” 

Julie thinks about this for a moment. “Well, Carl, we’re in a pocket universe right now. The rules of Earth and Middle-Earth may not apply equally here.” she says.

“Why would that be?” asks Carl.

“Well, based on the stela outside and some other factors, I think magic is a diegetic reality here, and presumably middle-earth. On earth itself, it may be a bit more nuanced.” She continues.

“When you say diegetic, you mean there’s some conceit on your part that we live in a narrative? A fiction?” Carl asks.

“Well, yes. Based on the stela on the outskirts of Anza I believe that this is a story: half written, half coded. In this context magic exists.. This would likely be substantiated by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view debating evidence like the stela and magic users in the city.” Julie continues.

“Well, that is quite a bold claim, Julie. Perhaps you are right. So long as the available evidence supports this idea. But…doesn’t this preclude your own epistemology?” Carl asked.

Julie looked up pensively “Well, not exactly…as you know I believe the more times an a posteriori claim is verified, the more true it can be assumed to be. In this case, I do think there is some verifiable evidence to meet that point—however fantastic that may be. In this case, there is a stela that describes the existence of magic here. It also holds some predictive power as it consistently guesses what potions Indicanus will attempt to make. Additionally, there are magic users that exist in this area. We can test their pyrokinesis in terms of fire size, temperature, and speed of fireballs.”

“I would love to test these with you as well. Perhaps I can make some time if you’d like to show me this stela on the edge of town that suggests this is the case.” Carl offers.

“Absolutely! Let’s go! (๑>ᴗ<๑)” Julie says.

As the two walk out, Gandalf finishes re-stocking the shelves.

As his shift comes to an end, Cyndi Lauper approaches him. “Good work today Gandalf. You know, today is your 460437564th day on the job, and I gotta say you’ve been fantastic!” She says.

“Thanks Cyndi, I’m guessing no raise, though.” He muses.

“Haha, you’re so funny Gandalf. But yeah, if you were getting a raise for all this time, you’d own the planet I imagine. We reserve that right to the people who worked hard by being born into wealth and failing upwards though, you know that.”

Gandalf nods “Of course, of course. The world of men is a confusing one, truly.” He says.

“And girls. We can be confusing too, you know.” She says pointedly.

“...and girls. My apologies, just a common turn of phrase in my world.” Gandalf says, nodding warmly and receptively to her pop-feminist interjection.

“Well, what’s your plan today?” She asks.

“You know, my mind is muddled by this accursed forever weed. I may wander the Sonoran desert today, and be guided by intuition as beasts are.” 

“Oh, okay. I’m having a movie night tonight if you wanna come.” She says.

“Oh yeah actually that sounds better.”

Gandalf leaves the Circle K, pulling a sword with skateboard wheels and trucks attached to the bottom. With a flick of Narya, he pushed mongo off Anduril and rode down to the smoke shop.

Pharaoh’s Pyramid was a smoke shop on a technicality, but once you were inside you realized it was a crystal shop with a side helping of vape products. The walls and containers were adorned with hieroglyphics and impressive paintings of Egyptian deities lined the walls. At one time he knew Eru was the only true God in middle-earth, but now that he was far removed from his home, he had often wondered who sat on the throne of this world. In fact, he wondered if there were many thrones…or none at all. Eru Iluvatar was ignoring him now, that was for sure. He tried to push this thought from his mind as he looked at an assortment of blood-orange gems. He placed his hand into the box of beveled beads, letting the smooth jasper roll across his fingers and one by one fall into the box in a cascade of crimson clinks.

“Oh, hey Gandalf” the shopkeeper said, wiping down a counter. “You see anything good today?” She asked. “Oh certainly, but I’m still making up my mind.” Gandalf said. He meandered from one area to the next, until he found several chunks of citrine and lapis lazuli that caught his attention.

As he grabbed these, he bumped into a man in a suit turned from him, and as he stumbled he dropped a scoop of thrifty ice cream from his cone. He turned to look at Gandalf, pulling the aviator shades from his face. It was at that moment Indicanus realized that he pissed off Joe Biden.

“Easy on the mustard you gerbil eared telephone operator!” Dark Brandon said, his aura faceted with fire opals and obsidian—an unholy marriage of scarlet and vantablack forming a vortex around him. Several of the gems around them started lifting from their places, suspended in midair as spacetime cowered before the forty-sixth’s death stream (四六 = 死流).

“Easy, friend, my apologies. Allow me to compensate for your ice cream.” Gandalf offered, staff shaking in his hand. He knew his magic was no match for Dark Brandon in its current state.

The aura disappeared as soon as it came, Joe Biden putting his glasses back on. “Whatever you say, Jack.” he said, grabbing a Stiiizy pod and puffing a fat cloud like a boss before heelying out.

Gandalf sighed, happy to narrowly avoid certain death. “Actually, I think I’ll get one of those, too.” he said, paying for both of their carts. After grabbing a Stiiizy pod for himself and putting it in his crossbody bag for later.

After leaving the store, Gandalf rode his board down to Yilberto’s, settling into a corner booth. He ordered a salmon burrito then, on a whim, decided to eat it while skating down the  pala Casino.

Gandalf opened the front door, greeted by the ashy scent of cigarettes and regret (cigret) and wandered through the lobby. Security approached him “Sir, we’ve talked to you before. You know you can’t walk in here with a flaming sword skateboard and a giant staff.” He said. Gandalf flicked Narya and lit the guard’s pubes on fire. He crumpled to the floor like one of those wooden animal toys with the strings in it that fall over when you press in on the wood platform because it adds slack to the string that holds the wood together. You know, one of those toys you might have gotten from a tourist trap, but didn’t ever play with for more than a few minutes because when you think about it it’s pretty limited in movement, and doesn’t really lend itself well to extended play sessions with your other toys for various reasons.

Anyway, Gandalf walked past the security guard whose nuts were just lightly sauteed in the fires of unfuckwithability (Narya), and continued on his way. Security at this point learned to leave Indicanus be. He never seemed to actually cause damage unless provoked. Additionally, he often lost thousands of dollars any time he visited—a trait many casinos find incredibly endearing.

He walked by the craps table, past the pai gow and endless Caishen slot machines. Gandalf often wondered if that’s how one communed with the god of wealth, and if any of the Dedun fetishes in Pharaoh’s Pyramid might work on Caishen as well. Of course, Gandalf didn’t need a god of wealth after living rent free in Anza for 2,097,605 years. He just needed a god of finding the goddamn potion he needed to get out of there (probably Thoth).

He finally settled on the “Double 4” slot machine. There was something satisfying about the rattling of older mechanical slots that the newer fancy digital ones couldn’t match. The whirring was hypnotic, a dazzling display of dizzying dials transfixed his tired and tarnished tew.

Minutes turned to hours, hours to shi chen, shi chen to split shifts. Finally, he sat up, his ancient spine crackling like cheap fireworks thrown in the street by your least favorite neighbor. He arched his back, yawning loudly before leaving.

He skated back across his dusty and ancient town, finally making his way back to Cyndi’s house.

༄༅། །Bracketed Sites: The climb to the caverns of contra-cis[]crip contemplation

Special Thanks (in no particular order): Lunnaroz, blooj, AHugeHildaFan, and Marharth



Squidward squiddled his way up the mountain, his feet shriveled from the continuous puckering of his suction cups against the rocky terrain. His tongue and skin were still a deep plaid from his earlier mishap: falling into a vat of pretty patty sauce, eating it all, the plaid going to his thighs, then him exploding such that:

P(Gφ→FPNφ→EPNφ→TNφ→Ex)

He thought about that recent memory bitterly. Although it was only minutes ago it felt like yesterday. In those days, in those distant days. In those nights, in those far-off nights. As 𒌓tnapis𒍣tim was unable to unenshare man from mortality, neither could Squidward free himself from his pillory of plaid punishment.

As he sat in the vat, he had a spat with a man in a hat who sat and asked him to chat with his cast. The man who appeared instantly in front of him had no head, just large teeth with eyes floating within. “Hello my putty angel with a silver smile, my name is Caine, and I need your help with 𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝔸𝕞𝕒𝕫𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝔻𝕚𝕘𝕚𝕥𝕒𝕝 ℂ𝕚𝕣𝕔𝕦𝕤 in this cave. Just hike up this mountain trail in Southern California and await further instructions from THE COUNCIL.” The lighting dramatically changed around him as he said this. Just a moment later, a bubble appeared by him with large teeth “Maan f*$!k the council!”

“Bubble, you can't keep swearing!” Caine yelled.

“Yes, scream for daddy.” 

Caine raises his hands and huffs “Bubble stop it!” He turned to Squidward quickly “Sorry for that RUDE bubble, Squidward. Anyway, best of luck on your quest!” He said before flying into space. The memory still lingered in Squidward's mind as he walked up the increasingly steep mountain trail.

As the hike up the Etiwanda hill trailhead chipped away at his stamina, Squidward took a brief respite, letting the mountain air smooth his burning lungs. It was one thing to be hiking on his own, and another entirely to be a sea creature on land making this journey. He pulled a brass telescope from his bag, looking down at the city of Rancho Cucamonga. 

His vision blurred, sharpening into focus as he saw the familiar lines of antlers sharpen. The front of the building said “Bass Pro Shop: Home to Hunters, Fishers, and other kinds of Liars.” 
 
He saw two men exiting the store, associates carrying out a large hot tub. The first man had wavy white hair and a charming, fangy smile. The second was a bit more bashful, wearing a cloak and sporting a dashing brown beard and long, thick hair that swept down his neck like murky mysterious waterfalls.

“Hmmmph, Astarion/Gale getting another hot tub it seems…” he said, imagining his own steamy night of passion with his lovers (Boris Yeltsin and Geordi LaForge, naturally) their bodies tying in tantric tessellations like the two that telescopically tantalized him down below. 



He sighed deeply before continuing his journey.

He huffed as his hike had him heaving with heavy steps, until he finally reached the foot of the cave. As he entered the stone-womb, he heard the mirthful laughing of many inside. They turned to greet him.

The trans[]crip council were as joyous as they were powerful, their blue bodies emanating the highest magnitude of transgender crippled aura in aquamarine hues like summer skies and ocean reefs. They were vedas with two juggernaut wheels; guardians to the keys to the akashic records of a new theory of being on the intersections of transness and (dis)ability. 



Jax sat with the council, criss cross applesauce on the floor like the whiny fucking baby he was. He looked up at Squidward with a smug little grin. “Hey Squids, me and the council were just playing mahjong but I don't get it.” And he threw them at Squidward. Just fucking threw them.

   🀁         🀃🀆
🐇 🀀   🀂    🀃
        🀄 🀁      🀈  🀋 💢🦑 
    🀅   🀀
👩🏽‍🦽👩🏽‍🦼👨🏼‍🦽🧑🏽‍🦼🧑‍🦼

The tiles pinged off Squidward’s head and fell to the ground, tikatakakakatakit.

“Ugh, Jax is tormenting the NPCs again.” Zooble said, rolling their eyes and talking to no one in particular.

A member of the council with a white tutu and no ear waved their hand, the tiles hovering and hanging with holy halo halations, then hazy in their homecoming to the realm of forms as the ideal mah-jong tiles. 

“Enough” they boomed. “We are all here today to discuss the findings of Tertön I.M. Meen…” as the council rolled their wheelchairs back, the horrid wizard man danced forwards, his suspenders falling as we walked towards Squidward and the Amazing Digital circus crew. 

“Big old scary bathroom, see them shudder, watch them squirm. How I H̶̨̝̱̠̬̦͂̾͐̾̓̔̈́̓͝͠A̶̢̬̪͔̞̱͓̜̘̺̅͛̾̓̉͑͘͘͠T̵̠̲͈̤̙̱͉̩̘̻̼̈́̿E̸͍̿̈́ populist nationalism, how it makes my stomach churn!” I.M. Meen delivered in song.

He opened his book, and the pages turned seemingly on their own. A structure emerged from the tome, familiar pictograms of a man and woman on triangular and circular placards respectively emerging from the pages like bamboo shoots from Arashiyama. As the structure expanded, stones began flipping on the cave, some lifting from the ground. With each flip, the stones became shinier, taking on navy blue or white color. As the mah-jong tiles had left, now wall tiles were appearing. Sinks followed, then stalls as the platonic ideal of a bathroom now made up the cave. 

The council member with the beard spoke “Bathrooms are the ontological Nexus of the trans debate; the mount Meru of trans discourse in the public space. This is the place where the peaks of race, ability, and gender collide, the Chushi Gangdruk of discourse emanating from here to the intellectual valleys of Twitter and Gavin Newsom's bitch mouth.

As disabled people, we often find ourselves deemed unworthy of gender by society, relegated to bathrooms that have conveniently been ungendered in ways the culture war seems to ignore. 

In this way, our disability separates us from the gender binary—and by extension—excommunicates us from binary bathrooms.”

The slender council member with hoop earrings continues. 

“Race also plays a role in who is awarded gender recognition in this space. Many bathrooms in the South would be marked “Women's”, “Mens”, or “Colored”. Now, if gendered bathrooms are so important for traditional values, why were gendered bathrooms not deemed important for people of color or disabled people? Isn't it interesting how people of color are not only robbed of their humanity in this society, but also more likely to be diagnosed with disability?”

The council member with the longer perm continued “How many marginalized people do you think were integral to scientific progress as creators and as testees, but were never credited for their contributions? The examples are countless, and among those people are crips that the cis and abled sought to “cure”.

The idea of a “cure” deeply affects trans and disabled people. It is a binary concept that offers little room for complexity or variation from a perceived “norm” that smooths over a reality too abrasive for the hegemonic Tlön being built before us. 

dis/abled bodies are viewed as oppositional as new binaries are built brick by brick.”

Tertön I.M. Meen continues “Trans and disabled intersectional experiences are rarely disc̴͇͐u̸̩͆͝s̴͈̎͆s̷̞̗͊ed in writing, which is why this word was made! Trans[]crip is a word that helps us fill those brackets with all the many b̴̹̝͉̜̈́ỳ̴̦̩̭̿̄ways where we experience joy, suffering, violence, aspiration, theory, and topographical symbols.” He continues, ripping his shirt to show off his top scars radiating with purple patterns.

Everyone clapped. Except Jax. Jax had fallen asleep.

Pomni looked up at I.M. Meen “How did you pronounce the brackets?”

“What?”

“You said trans[]crip” Pomni said

“...How did I say that? Shouldn't that sound like trans crip?” she shook her head and looked down at the tile floor, bathed in silence.

“I don't know what you mean, Pomni. You just said trans[]crip twice.” He finally said. 

Zooble looked up “So is this different from saying trans* or trans-?”

Gangle looked at her zoobled companion, shaking her head “How is that possible?”

Jax sat up, smiling “It's possible—Right Pomni?”

Pomni rolled her eyes and looked away.

Jax looked around at the sink behind them and the stalls in front of them, then back down at the tile he rested on. 

“...am I laying on the bathroom floor?”

“... it's possible.”

“Shut up, Pomni.”

༎ ༎


༈ “So what's the difference between trans*, trans-, and trans[]crip?” Zoobled reiterated

I.M. Meen continued in his high-pitched, nasally voice “Well bookworm, trans- refers to a Ṣ̵̼̫̗̩͍͍͐̓͝T̷̢̡̝̜̳̳̽̓̿A̷̧͔̩̞̞̲͊̾T̷̘̔̃͝Ë̶̺̰̲̠̩́̈́̊͑̌͆͝ of change. This is the original usage in Latin, and differs from the modern use of T̸̥͝R̵̰̪̚A̴̠̋̏Ñ̸̗̅Ṣ̸̪͛̓͒ as a noun. Like the phrase ‘trans studies’.

The asterisk in trans* is meant to mark something we cannot name or know. It's a magic laboratory where we can change the way things go.

But trans[]crip brings balance to the trans and crip worlds. It's like having them both share an asterisk with curls.” 

Zoobled nodded “Oh I see. It's kind of like being trans can change how you experience disability, and disability can change how you experience transness. So this book you found is meant to examine that space where the experiences collide?”

I.M. Meen nodded, pulling a flower from his jacket “Precisely, bookworm. That space is your own personal microwave and you can S̸̢̭̼͍̙͈̚͜ͅH̵͍̰͋̂̑̎̊̿͂̑͌̈͜Ǫ̸̨̞̫̫͇̫̦̆̓̈́̀̑ͅV̷̨̹̮̦̼̻̈́̔Ę̵̱̹̹͗̊̅̈́͑͒̽̇̄̀͝ whatever you like inside! Have fun!” He said laughing as he placed the flower on his lapel before removing it again (why does he do that?) then disappeared into a shimmering of ephemeral sparkles and clouds, only his eyes remaining briefly before popping out of existence.”

Jax looked at where I.M. Meen was. “This adventure is weird…I don't like it.”

Zoobled looked over at Jax “Actually, this is one I put in the suggestion box.” They say.

“What? Why?” 

“Well…I didn't choose that guy, or this adventure exactly, but I asked to learn more about what it means to be me, and why I’m like…this” Zoobled continues, looking down at their hand. 

Ragatha put her hand on Zooble’s shoulder “Hey that's nice Zooble, now we can all learn more about what it means to be you.”

The convoluted shape-beast nodded “Yeah, it was actually…pretty sweet of Cain to put this together.”

Jax’s eyes narrow, his mouth clenching on one side. “Okay I vote we skip this one.” Jax said, his declaration followed with silence. He looked down at where the voting screen usually is. “Hey, what gives!?” He said.

“Yeah, we don't vote for this one. Cain thought it was important we learn about this.” Zooble said. 

Jax rolled his eyes and put his hands behind his head. “Whaatever, I'll be over here, on the cool kids side of the bathroom.” He stood up and walked to the corner nearest the sinks, his bushy tail waving by Pomni.

Kinger poked his head out of the toilet and looked at the rest of the digital circus “I’m…barely in this chapter, aren’t I?” 
༎ ༎


༈The tiles in the bathroom spun again, slowly returning to their spelunkenly rocky textures and dark earth tones.

The council remained, the one with the hoop earrings speaking. “Another thing about the word trans[]crip is how it forms an avatar for testing far beyond the boundaries of intersectionality or integration. 

Like how transness is seen as a form of madness, but to actually be trans and mad is different. Despite these ideas being distinct, they are still experienced in a single stream of consciousness. 

Kinger, head shoved into a toilet, raised a finger “Oh I see, so that’s where the brackets come in again. It’s kind of like you can explain there is a relation without losing the distinctness of either…madness doesn’t necessarily need a cure, and neither does being different in other ways. Maybe, we just need to be there for each other, instead of trying to fix each other.”

The council member nodded “That’s brilliant, Kinger. The psychological challenges that emanate from gender dysphoria can be just as debilitating as other mental disabilities, which will naturally meet in the brackets of trans[]crip, and don’t necessarily need to be cured.”

༄༅། །Chuck said fuck as his nuts were tucked between his knees and squeezed when stuck. 

“Chesus priced, this kimono is a bit tight huh?” He said, rubbing his groin with a grimace. 

“Sorry, Chuck. It's very hard to tailor a kimono to a rat of your…erm…stature.” Ryotaro said. Chuck could swear he saw a snicker flicker beneath the kitsune’s whiskers before his hand danced in front of his mouth. 

“Perhaps you enjoyed thanksgiving a bit too much?” 

“Fair enough” The rat nodded, he couldn't argue with that. He had consumed at least three turkeys when entertaining their last guests, burping out their bones and all. And one of those turkeys turned out to be a local Scottish boy who had ironically failed to consume his own grandfather (bones and all) on his scott-mitzvah. This meant the boy was struck by a local shaman and unable to become an adult. Surely being bite of eighty-sevened by Charles the Entertainment Cheese was the more noble fate for him. 

“Well, don't let your spirits be brought down too much. You need to entertain our new guests. It's vital this goes well if our new theme park is going to be successful.” Ryotaro continued. 

“Right right, relax. I got this in the bag like a pound of Munch tickets.” 

“Alright, then make yourself presentable.”

Chuck wet the brush with animal fats, lightly brushing them down his fur. The nape of his neck was exposed by the back of his kimono, and bore the gentle elegance of a snowdrop blooming in winter’s remise to Konohanasakuya-hime. 

As he whitened his fur, his mentor did the same. She deftly patted her face with a large brush that swallowed her petite hands. 

“Gee, I dunno Cyndi. This is a lot to ask of an apprentice like me.” Chuck said, pulling on the collar of his kimono. 

“Hey, don't sweat it Chuck. You've performed in a band before, right?” Cyndi Lauper offered. Even as a Geisha, she couldn't help but sit criss-cross, bouncing a foot to a beat only she could hear. 

“Well yeah but those were kids. These guys are big shot executives at Capcom…” Chuck said, fumbling the brush in his brutish paws and dropping it. Cyndi knelt down and slowly picked it up and placed it in his hands. As he tried to turn back to the mirror, he felt a tug at his hand and he looked back. She was holding his hand with both of hers, eyes reflecting his toothy grimace back at him.

“We've both been performers for a long time, Chuck. And if you could take over Showbiz and make yourself the mouse you are today, I know you can do it. But all that star power you've built over the years won't count if you don't believe like you do in your make believe band. Do you get me?”

“Yeah! That's just what I need!” Chuck nodded, getting his makeup on. 

He knew being a geisha wasn't easy. Two years of learning the language, six years of cultural studies and dance and etiquette training. The knot in his chest hearing girls who should have been celebrating their birthdays with him mocking his accent and pulling his tail. It was a rocky road he walked in geta too small for him, and his journey seemed to be perpetually uphill. 

But as he stepped into the room, salarymen with sakazuki traced by clumsy fingers, he knew his moment had arrived. Where a geisha can be a geisha.༎ ༎

༈Chapter 2:

The executives were surrounding the table, one a small puppet with a [[Devilish Smile]]. 

Another looked up at him, balancing a sake bottle on his finger, his grin rippling across his face as if suppressing a sexy burp. “Hello gorgeous. I am mmmmMok.”

Chuck looked down at one of the salarymen, lust written on his half closed eyelids. As he did, the salarymen pulled away his glasses, revealing himself to be Turkie!

“Nice Cock, bitch” he said, raising a shotgun. 

The End.༎ ༎


The box ghost approaches you tentatively, rubbing his gloved hands together. The box ghost laughs, then tells you he had feelings for you for a long time. He wants you to know the divorce is an opportunity for you. It wasn't your fault. He rests his hand for a moment too long on your shoulder, his gaze betraying an attachment mired in desperation. The box ghost says "I have a special package for youuuuuu." He throws you onto the ghost bed, he's so strong yet so gentle. You can see his erectoplasm forming in his duck boxers (what other underwear would be fitting for the box ghost?) The box ghost merged his ghost body with yours. "Ooooooh" he says. "Maybe instead I'll become the WAP ghoooooost." You feel slimy, like when your brother dropped a milkshake in the car on that roadtrip a few years ago. You can't remember if it was 2014 or 2016 right now. Anyway, he makes your WAP feel like a box of fruit gushers AOC stepped on.

༈ Techno-Raiders of the Electric Arc



Xiern (写人) was trapped in tepid tanks of temporal tedium with the tutelage of thoroughly tracking terran trips twenty-to-thirty times: a transfixed tracing of the trail of Teoyaomicqui. No sixth hour would come, and as long as her movements were perfect she would never meander to the maw of Mictlān, that final qualia locked away from her in that glass paywall of eternal slumber. “Thy heart knows.” In quetzal plumes, in fragrant flowers, in friendship as it sparkles like static sitting on the side of the screen she’s scarcely seen. 

Sixth hour, twentieth day, tenth month, nineteen hundred and ninety-seven. If Jesus died at the age of thirty-three, it’s Nas-ty how she was trapped at twenty-one to be dead with twelve disciples and zodiac signs.

Xiern opened the front door to her house, the familiar tickatackcatakcit 
 of her dog’s ramose toes in prancing throes as he chose to stōde on his hind legs with nose pressed against her leg to beg. She smiled and pet his head, walking inside to find her abode warm with rays from the sun that shone as she hummed to herself in mirthful tones.

After driving to the local mall and browsing the aisles of games at Radioshack, she found a copy of “Dilbert’s Desktop Games”. She could feel her neurons buzzing like a hundred thousand Tokyoites bumping past one another; a pathological pachinko machine in the parlor of her phenomenology. She ran her fingers along the plastic holding the green paper casing of the game, Dilbert’s perpetually upturned tie and akimbo poseology likewise upturning her lips into a smile like a boat𓊛 carrying an o老d f朋en友.

She giddily giggled as her mind’s machinations projected celluloid made of a billion dendrites, an escheresque tableau of the familiar office workers in their banal tango of kafkaesque idiocracy. The familiar sardonic quips of Alice. The lovable slackenly antics of Wally. The machiavellian scheme-atics of Dogbert. And of course Dilbert, the straight-man foil that shaped the Djerbian lotovores that made up his narrative world. Honestly, she knew she would have more fun imagining what the game could be on her drive home than she probably would actually playing the thing, but that in itself was a kind of entertainment she relished.

She sat in her room, installing the game. She waited, and waited. Time dragged its rusted hull along the reef of her mind, grating at her consciousness (she waited for nearly an hour and microwaved herself a Hot Pocket™). She watched the bar fill up intermittently between bites of her meal and episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the soothing voice of Patrick Stewart wafting over her like opium smoke. Finally, the bar filled up. She hovered her cursor over the start button. As she clicked it on her cold pixelated screen, Dilbert rode by on a UFO, crashing down to her desktop in digitized discord. 

A green light shone out from the screen, bathing Xiern in verdant hues as her body became increasingly translucent. At first, she hardly noticed, thinking her beige monitor was simply shining brighter. But soon, she could see the wood grooves of her desk under her hands, then she could scarcely see her hands at all. It was as if she was experiencing the rainbow body; her form emanating into the universe, false distinctions shed like her skin and shell from the soul and spirit.

But then, she was just as suddenly somewhere new. She felt the spongy brown carpet under her shoes, the canvas-textured cubicles that glid along her fingertips and blended into an earthtone blur of postmodern, pre-millennial purgatory. As the hordes of office workers approached her—expressions unshifting as stone carvings—she realized she had fallen into her game as Wu Daozi fled into his own paintings.༎ ༎

Twenty-eight years had passed; the temporal mandala a juggernaut treading over her, pressing Xiern into the mud of a digital world. Every day, the slings and arrows of outrageous secretaries forming a sea of indifference from knowing troubles too well. 

The death-blows of a thousand NPCs, puzzle-doors of a hundred rooms, and dextrous speed-running of the office-gauntlet had become simple steps for her. She sighed as she looked over, one of many facsimiles of the secretary Carol Cerebrus looking down at her from the sights of a crossbow and taking fire three times. She sighed as she jumped over the cubicle, landing a perfect flip into the next cubicle over. Xiern sat inside for some time, ruffling through the three-ring binders and books in the file organizers at either side.

Her system of organization was byzantine, a network of tomes bound by circumstance and 245280 hours of near continuous reading on her part, a jackpot in a blackjack of odds stacked fat by the bric-à-brac of RadioShack.

While quixotic, quantities of quaint and curious volumes of forgotten lore abounded in this digital home of hers. The raven never came in the code of the game, but instead in name and bade Xiern to remain. She had uncovered thousands of books in this time, feeling each one with a tender smile. And in a while she would find, Huginn and Muninn those paths unwind.

She ran her hands along the books she stored in this worn filing cabinet, paint chipping with thousands of uses. “Garden of Forking Paths”, “Beyond State, Power, and Violence”, and a dozen other books lined this cabinet. She ran her finger along all of them, looking for her favorite amongst the tomes. Finally, she collected “Black Skin; White Masks” in her hands, the weight of the book like a foot of jade in manus with many minutes already.

She then sat at the computer, booting up the beige behemoth. The monitor, flicker-glass, opened with the square displays of Windows ‘95. 

The eterna𓎛 𓈖ovements 𓇳f day ripp𓎛ing over in cycles of candle wicks and sunlight morphiated into temporal torpor by 𓍹Thoth𓍺 like tears of the poppy. Her only escape was through these interfaces—shadows on the wall of a world she longed to return to. 


She opened Yahoo AIM, looking through her recent contacts.


Xiern: I finished editing this issue, I also have a few articles if you’d like to include them.
Minos: Thanks! You’re a lifesaver. I can’t find anyone else who can work on your schedule.
Xiern: Well no one else has free time like I do.
Minos: Apparently, and your articles look so good too! I’m just reading through them now and WOW. You seem to understand Fanon’s work really well.
Xiern: Like I said, I’ve had time. I’ve been stuck here.
Minos: You really never break character do you?
Xiern:...you know me. Always the jokester…
Minos: I would love to meet you ftf someday, you’re just so fascinating.
Xiern: One day…lmk when you have the rough drafts for the next issue.
Minos: Will do! 


Xiern closed the chat, returning to her copy of Fanon’s. She opened up her personal website, pasted through Web 1.0 and BBS systems to her rickety-ass desktop computer. She bounced with anticipation as the screen loaded, top-to-bottom, images loading in slow procession like priests descending from the pyramid. 

PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION

She had been studying this particular algorithm for some time, the simplistic beauty a boogie-woogie of pietian particularity; fai chun leading to her auspicious victory from the samsara of pixels and clip art she had been in for twenty-eight years. 

She had tried for what was now over half of her existence to intentionally no-clip through the game—a process of phasing through solid objects without the expected collision. While this often happened in games by chance or accident, it had been hard to reproduce in such a simple game as her current world.

Day: 10227

Rather than a manual test, I have decided to model the problem of my escape using the same group dynamics found in schools of fish or flocks of birds. These sorts of programs can more easily find a global minimum—the ideal solution along a brobdingnagian landscape of options impossible to test manually or in a Swift fashion. 

Oftentimes, computer algorithms cannot truly find the global minimum, as testing each option with even the world’s strongest computer would take longer than the universe has existed. In this case, I have to hit the right spot, at the right time, with the right velocity. 

Even those three factors alone could lead to billions of potential solutions. If there were other factors, my search could easily blossom into a fractal lotus of factorial digitude.

Ultimately, the real struggle of statistics, science, and epistemology broadly is our inability to know what we do not know. There can be three factors or a thousand. Even if I did eventually make a means to escape, there’s no telling if I uncovered all the information on how to escape or if I just uncovered enough to make a model that would get me out by coincidence. 

I’m developing a swarm of agents (the population the swarm and dots on the screen the agents respectively) flickering about in the search space (in this case, the various levels of the game I’m trapped in).

Each candidate moves according to the local minima of their own location AND the local minima of their population. Think of this like drops of water trying to find the lowest point on the crater-laden surface of the moon. Now think of it like ants trying to do it with their ANT BRAINS. 

There’s no guarantee that this thing works, but it often works well enough. It might not find the lowest crater on the moon (the global minima) but it will find a pretty deep crater (local minima). 

There are two types of memory among the ants: pbest and gbest. Pbest represents the individual memory of the best spot, the hazy nostalgia which percolates through the ant’s childhood into its life as a middle-aged, office-dwelling, sad ant longing for the simplicity of youth (sigh!) while gbest represents the collective memory of the best spot, a formicine collective unconscious longing for the simplicity of the Jung (another sigh!)



THE MATH

This is where it gets interesante:

f:ℝⁿ→ℝ

Let f be a gradient of the natural numbers (which is what ℝ is). f is just a function, but in this case has several real variables ℝⁿ which represents real integers that are coordinates in this grid representing the search space. This vector field gives the rate of fastest increase for several variables in a scalar-valued differentiable function.

ℝⁿ = {x₁,x₂,…,xₙ): xᵢ∊ℝ, 𝑖 = (1,2,...,n)

So, ℝⁿ is the space of all ordered n tuples of real numbers: x = (x₁,x₂,…,xₙ). This is how we represent all coordinates on a cartesian plane (think like the grids you use in battleships to sink your brother’s battleship but the little shit keeps moving the ships when you’re not looking so your strategy of skipping every second square doesn’t work (asshole)).

So in this case ℝ³ would have 3 coordinates like you would need for a three-dimensional space (X,Y, and Z coordinates). Thankfully, my prison is 2 dimensional, so I’m a little bit less boned here than I would be otherwise. 

For 𝑖 = 1,2,...,n we can say xᵢ the ᵢth coordinate of x.

To put it simply, this is a direction to move that points in the direction of the greatest increase in a function. To put it more simply, it measures how steep a line is.

Since we don’t start out knowing the gradient, we need to find a solution for a where f(a)≤f(b) for every agent in the search space. Basically, a is the global minimum and the ants are b. 

If S represents the number of ants in mommy’s little ant swarm, then xᵢ∊ℝⁿ would be the position of every one of mommy’s special little ants (I am ant mom, not to be confused with auntie matter from other physics equations). 

xᵢ∊ℝⁿ says that the the individual data points in the data set (xᵢ) are an element of the n-dimensional space of real numbers.

If I DLL inject a code that makes this kind of program into the game I’m stuck in, perhaps I can find the right wall to run into to get out of here! 


- Xiern 0


Empiricism and statistics, damned by the pyrrhonian tapeworm that crawled right out of Judge Schreber’s solar anus. 

Xiern sat at the keyboard, ten hours deep into the code that she hoped would save her, John 3+1+6. The only begotten idea she had loved to return to the world.

She typed out her code, meticulously iterating over her process until it was perfect for her 2d search space. The descent like Dante through the divisions of Diyu, deeper and deeper into the depths of local minima.

import numpy as xie
import matplotlib.pyplot as ren
 
def f(x,y):
    return (x-3.14)**2 + (y-2.45)**2 + xie.sin(3*x+2.80) + xie.sin(4*y-4.12)
 
x, y = xie.array(xie.meshgrid(xie.linspace(0,5,100), xie.linspace(0,5,100)))
z = f(x, y)
x_min = x.ravel()[z.argmin()]
y_min = y.ravel()[z.argmin()]
ren.figure(figsize=(8,6))
mictlan = 'lower'
limbo = 'inferno'
ren.imshow(z, extent=[0, 5, 0, 5], origin=mictlan, cmap=limbo, alpha=0.5)
ren.colorbar()
ren.plot([x_min], [y_min], marker='x', markersize=100, color=’white’)
contours = ren.contour(x, y, z, 10, colors=’black’, alpha=0.4)
ren.clabel(contours, inline=True, fontsize=8, fmt="%.0f")
ren.show()


Finally, she opened the game on the desktop, a recursive dream of the self imagining its form. 
She added the code to the player’s movements in the program: bert.dll. As she ran the code she stood up; and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up, and stood up.

She looked to herself and back again. One-hundred copies, all exact, but moving in different directions as determinism diffused her decisions into a dillegrout of diasporas. Each walked, then ran, from place to place in the room. Some ran into walls before bouncing back to the center of the Xiern swarm, others running in wide arcs. The swarm began its impossible crawl from section to section of the office; the search space reached each of the one-hundred and thirty-two potential practice levels.

She ran along the familiar walls and cubicles. An office worker lunges at her, mouth snapping as he screamed expletives that flew at her. She narrowly ducked as the $!@# flew over her head, vaporizing one of her copies.

She returned fire with a taser, running past him with her agent swarm. 

Xiern-0, Xiern-Prime, Xiern-α ran in the center of the swarm, until it happened. One of her copies ran a wide arc into a wall, and vanished. Soon, another went, and another. Eventually, only fifteen of her copies remained, slowly pacing around the no-clip point. 

She looked at the spot: an ordinary wall. She breathed in, then out, each exhalation accelerating her heartbeat. She leaned slightly forward, then ran. Ran until she met the wall, and closed her eyes as she felt nothing, then the kiss of cool night air as she fell,

and fell,

and fell….༎ ༎

Do you hear it? The pinging of pinballs bouncing from one place to the next? That's us. God is an angry teenager, drunk off stolen booze his friend's sketchy older brother gave him, burning through his allowance to watch us pitifully ping past our prime, until we're relegated to the gobble-hole of fate. 

Thankfully, perhaps, life is just the beginning. In death, you get to be a whole new kind of loser.

You often think about what kind of ghost you'll be. You've seen the exploits of famous superhero Danny Phantom, and it's hard to not be jealous. Handsome, tall, and amazing powers? It seems glamorous. Even if he's spending so much of his short mortal life—much less his youth—mucking about a world that will be his solitary abode for all eternity,you must say it is pretty bitchin. 

Your life is far less glamorous. It's not that you don't want to do something big, it just feels a bit out of reach for you. Like, you've put in the effort every here and there, but then your mom got sick, then you got sick. You got a job to manage things, and before you knew it five years went by. Five years sucked away by the gobble-hole of capitalism.

Today, running your hand through your hair as a cool breeze caressed you like a dear friend, you felt you suddenly had the energy to do something. That's when you see it: an abandoned house.

Urban exploration, or urbex, always interested you. Maybe it was the adventure of it, a reclaiming of youth and rebellion you missed out on. Maybe it was the tantalizing promise of a life where you didn't pay rent. It's hard to say. As you enter, you peer around the corner and quietly announce your presence. “h-hello? Is anyone here?” You ask. It is silent. As you walk in further, you hear a slight shuffling, then a clatter as clutter splatters on one another to sunder as platters and matters clash in a sputtered blunder and—everything is torn asunder. 

Peeking around the corner, you see him. Tall, blue, and transparently handsome(transparent) it was the most handsome undead bachelor of Amity Park: The box Ghost. As he turned, you saw him in all his boxly glory: matching grey gloves and a grey shirt, and a matching blue hat with overalls. You looked him up and down, from his sharp blue suspenders to his handsome, round and angry face. As you looked down again, you realized that you were wholly, completely erect. 

The box ghost approaches you tentatively, rubbing his gloved hands together. The box ghost laughs, then tells you he had feelings for you for a long time. He wants you to know the divorce is an opportunity for you. It wasn't your fault. He rests his hand for a moment too long on your shoulder, his gaze betraying an attachment mired in desperation. The box ghost says "I have a special package for youuuuuu." He throws you onto the ghost bed, he's so strong yet so gentle. You can see his erectoplasm forming in his duck boxers (what other underwear would be fitting for the box ghost?) The box ghost merged his ghost body with yours. "Ooooooh" he says. "Maybe instead I'll become the WAP ghoooooost." You feel slimy, like when your brother dropped a milkshake in the car on that roadtrip a few years ago. You can't remember if it was 2014 or 2016 right now. Anyway, he makes your WAP feel like a box of fruit gushers AOC stepped on.

You were a painting mess, quivering on the pile of boxes he laid out for you. Your cock was throbbing, each pump a dump in your rump made you jump as the lumps and the clumps of the ghostly spunk left the rutt of your butt while you fondled your junk with a pump. 

It let out a few slow pumps, exhausting the last of its supply like water fountains around 2020 when cities across the US stopped maintenance and water supply for the fountains. They said it was for public safety and hygiene, but we all know it was to save a bit of money.

You felt your cum dissipate, and your sticky little cock shrink back down, like power rangers that just un-combined after beating the monster of the week.

A smile crept across your face. A palimpsest of pleasure and piqued passion particularly potent. With a final shift of the gear knob, you slowly stand up and hug the handsome poltergeist.

Xavier rambled into the home on diagon alley. A shakashuri flute playing in the distance "Huh, what's this? Some penchant of ramblement has been led astray." Harry Potter, now and adult, walks slowly towards him. Despite his height and facial hair, he is still every bit the pasty brit brat of the series. "What's this? What are you doing in my home?" Xavier stands, hand on his hip. "I'm here to recalibrate your rambling ramblement. It seems you've misplaced your moseying mind and prefer to sleep in boring nothingment." Xavier continues. (edited)

Harry flourishes his wand before pointing it at the chimeric freak "You leave now! Avada Kedavr-" Xavier's snake arm quickly devours Harry's wand. "Not so fast Hairy Bladder" Snakey says. The audience laugh track goes off. "It seems the snake has eaten Harry's wand. How will he get out of this one?" The narrator says. Snakey smiles at the audience. "Avada Kadavra? More like Avada the more like A sauna for llamas. Because you have to al-pack-a that avada ka trauma my little English muffin." Xavier says, putting his arm around Harry's shoulder and touching his finger to his pajama'd chest. (edited)

Harry threw up his arms, stomping on the ground. "You don't get it, nobody does! I slept in a closet for years! I peaked in high school! I married my best friend's creepy little sister and I'm a flatfoot has-been!" He yells. The shakashuri plays in the distance. And Xavier leads him to a steep mountainside. "I see the problem. You took your board and went rowling off the rad cliff, but now you have the dumb board creating your boredom." A static snail whispers "dumble boredom" as it slithers by Harry. "So now you have no place to skate...lastic. You’re cooked, so you can only surf ‘n’ terf." Xavier says. "Blimey" Harry says. "You're bloody right! This whole time I've been living a lie. I need to get my old Voldemort slaying self back! But how?" Harry asks. Xavier puts his arm around Harry's shoulder once more, and licks his extremely long tongue up Harry's face. "Meet your new magic mentors: Azka-bam Margera and Steve-O-patronus." As Xavier introduces them, Azka-Bam Margera jumps while throwing his arms up and Steve-O-patronus runs in place before pulling off his shirt to show off his moving tattoos. The tattoos are walking on a busy street when they suddenly stop and point at Xavier. "Good heavens, what is that ghastly creature?" A man with his wife asks, pointing at him. The woman in the tattoo, still gripping her husband, says back "Up yours honkney-sponk" , a loogey flying out of Steve-O-patronus's tattoo and hitting Xavier in the cheek with a splat. Xavier's head is knocked sideways from the impact as he licks it off.

The room was dim, lit only by the pale glow of a single candle. The heavy drapes fluttered slightly from the gentle wind that breezed through a cracked window. You sat nervously on a hard wooden chair in Snape's office, not entirely sure why you had been summoned.
Severus Snape looked even more mysterious than usual, his black robes seeming to blend with the shadows. He paced the room for a moment before coming to a stop in front of you.
"Do you know why you're here?" he asked, his voice as silky as ever.
You shook your head, "No, Professor. I don't."
He smirked, a rare sight, "Let's just say, there are certain... truths, I've come to realize."
Your heart raced. "Truths?"
Snape leaned in, his dark eyes searching yours. "You see, I've discovered something about myself that even I had not suspected. I am not just a mere potions master. I am... much more."
You tilted your head, puzzled. "What do you mean, Professor?"
His eyes glinted with mischief. "I am the true god of this world."
You blinked, unsure of how to respond. Was this some sort of test? A joke? But Snape didn't seem like the type to jest.
Seeing your hesitation, Snape continued, "I know it's hard to believe. But I've seen things, felt things, that prove my power. And I wanted you to be the first to know."
"Why me?" you whispered.
A small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. "Because," he murmured, leaning even closer, "there's something about you that's drawn me in. A magnetism I can't deny."
Your breath caught. Was Severus Snape... flirting with you?
"Think of the possibilities," he whispered, his breath warm on your ear. "Together, we could be unstoppable."
You met his gaze, your heart pounding. "Professor..."
But he silenced you with a finger to your lips. "Just think about it," he murmured.
And with that, he turned away, leaving you in stunned silence, the weight of his revelation and the allure of his flirtation heavy in the air.
The door suddenly burst open, and the unmistakable form of SpongeBob SquarePants, fully out of water and surprisingly adapted to the air of the Hogwarts dungeon, stood there, his usual jovial grin plastered across his face.
"Hey, everybody!" SpongeBob called cheerfully, seemingly unaware of the intense moment he'd just interrupted.
Snape's piercing gaze turned coldly to the sponge. "What are you doing here?"
SpongeBob seemed to think for a moment, placing a hand to his chin. "Well, I was just wandering around and thought I'd drop by. But since I'm here," he took a deep breath, puffing out his chest, "I have an announcement to make!"
You exchanged a bewildered glance with Snape. This was not what you'd expected from your day.
SpongeBob clapped his hands together. "You see, I've recently discovered that I'm not just any sponge. I'm the reincarnation of both Jesus and Krishna!" He struck a dramatic pose, arms outstretched.
A profound silence settled over the room.
Snape looked even more unimpressed than usual. "First, I find out I'm a god. Then, a sea sponge waltzes into my office claiming to be the reincarnation of divine figures. What's next?"
SpongeBob giggled, his earlier seriousness evaporating. "Life's full of surprises, isn't it?"
You could only nod in agreement, feeling like you'd been whisked away into the most peculiar dream. But in a place like Hogwarts, perhaps anything truly was possible.
Snape's eyes narrowed as he turned his full attention to the bubbly sea creature before him. "So, you're claiming to be the reincarnation of two major spiritual figures, both from distinctly different religious backgrounds, and yet you can't even remember to tie your own shoelaces?"
SpongeBob looked down, realizing one of his oversized shoes had come untied. He chuckled nervously. "Well, you know, sometimes the most enlightened beings have trouble with the little things."
Snape's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Oh, indeed. So, I'm to believe that in all your divine wisdom, you choose to spend your days flipping Krabby Patties and blowing bubbles?"
SpongeBob's square shoulders squared even further in defiance. "Hey! Bubbles are a profound metaphor for the fleeting nature of our lives in samsara! And besides, there's an art to making the perfect Krabby Patty."
Snape snorted, "I've dedicated years to the complex world of potions, and you equate that to... flipping burgers?"
SpongeBob pondered for a moment. "Well, Professor, both require a precise hand, a keen eye, and love!"
Snape looked momentarily taken aback, perhaps questioning his own reality, but then retorted, "Love? This is Hogwarts, not the Krusty Krab. Your whimsical declarations have NO bearing here." He said with a hiss.
SpongeBob, undeterred, flashed his trademark grin. "Just because something sounds silly, doesn't mean there isn't a deeper truth to it."
For a moment, the room was silent. Then, with a huff, Snape replied, "This conversation is over. I have more important matters to attend to than debating existential truths with a sponge."
The door to Snape's office, already having suffered the unceremonious entrance of SpongeBob, was subjected once more to a violent swing. This time, IM Meen burst forth with his wild hair and manic grin.
Snape groaned audibly, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Oh, God, really?"
IM Meen chuckled, wagging his finger with amusement. "Funny you should mention that!"
SpongeBob blinked his big, round eyes in confusion. "Who's this now?"
IM Meen took a dramatic bow, his cape flowing behind him. "Ah, for those unacquainted, I am IM Meen, the master of labyrinths and a lover of books, especially when they're filled with children who hate reading!"
Snape exhaled deeply, clearly regretting his earlier revelation. "Let me guess. You've come with some grand declaration about your divine heritage as well?"
IM Meen straightened up, giving Snape a sly look. "No, not at all. I just heard there was a gathering of characters making outrageous claims and thought it sounded like fun!"
The potions master's eyes darted between the bubbly sponge and the mad librarian. "My office has turned into a madhouse," he muttered.
SpongeBob, always one to find the bright side, chimed in, "Well, it's not every day you get to have a party with a god, the reincarnation of Jesus and Krishna, and... um, a book guy!"
IM Meen cackled, "Indeed! What a time to be alive... or fictional!"
Snape could only sigh, contemplating if any potion in his arsenal could make this surreal day a mere memory, remembering he confiscated some gin from the Weasley twins several days ago.
With a mix of exasperation and desperation, Snape reached into a cupboard behind him, pulling out the much needed bottle of gin. Without ceremony or a glass, he took a deep swig directly from the bottle, his Adam's apple bobbing with each gulp.
Watching this rare display of vulnerability, you cleared your throat, trying to make sense of the absurdity unfolding before you. "Professor... what exactly is going on here? I mean, first your revelation, then SpongeBob's, and now... him?" You gestured towards IM Meen, who was now animatedly discussing his favorite books with a somewhat overwhelmed SpongeBob.
Snape took another swig, wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve. "Frankly, I have no idea. Perhaps we've all been exposed to some hallucinatory potion? Or maybe this is a dream..."
You frowned, looking around the peculiar ensemble in the room. "It feels too... vivid to be a dream. And besides, if it's a dream, whose dream is it?"
Snape contemplated for a moment. "Given the day I've had, I wouldn't be surprised if it's mine. But the real question is: how do we end it?"
IM Meen, overhearing the conversation, sauntered over, a mischievous grin on his face. "Endings? Oh, I have a book about that! But you might not like where it takes you."
Snape groaned, taking yet another sip from his bottle. "At this point, I'm willing to take my chances."
The atmosphere within Snape's office became electric as the 'Book of Endings' began to vibrate with an intensity that defied its inanimate nature. Suddenly, a burst of light pierced the room, momentarily blinding everyone. As the brilliance faded, standing there in all his green, glorious stature was none other than Shrek himself.
All present, including the usually unflappable Snape and the eccentric IM Meen, immediately bowed their heads in reverence of the one true God. In unison, they chanted, "Shrek is love, Shrek is life."
Shrek, however, appeared troubled. His brow furrowed, he looked around the room, eyeing each person present. "Gents," he began with a note of regret, "I'm afraid to inform ye that we've had too much divinity for a single fanfiction today; It's tearing this world apart."
Before anyone could respond, a deep, unsettling rumble echoed from outside. You hurriedly approached the window, witnessing a bizarre sight. Though the sun had long set, the horizon was alight as if it were midday. A creeping, all-consuming white light began to inch its way across the landscape.
From the distance, Dumbledore emerged, running at full tilt towards the castle. But he was too slow. Just as the light was about to engulf him, he yelled out to you, his voice filled with both regret and determination: "What the hell are you doing, you motherf**kers!"
And then, he vanished.
Your heart raced, the gravity of the situation sinking in. You turned back to the room, and there was Shrek, his expression somber. Meeting your gaze, he murmured the words that would forever echo in your memory: "It's all ogre now."
THE END

Count Chocula runs his fingers down your face, slowly gliding each finger across your cheek and down to your neck. 

"My, vaht a night. Perfect for sharing a balanced breakfast, is it not?"

You nod your head, his large warm hand slowly enveloping your neck. It feels like those neck pillows that you put in the microwave, but burned because you could swear they took 5 minutes to heat up but it turns out they're only supposed to be in there for like 30 seconds.

You still wanted to use it, so you put it on, but it burns your skin and it smells like burnt rice, which isn't a terrible smell, but it's like the dark version of a good smell.

Like how, when you eat a good burrito, it smells amazing, but then someone has a fart that smells kind of burritocular and it's such a foul stench you actually develop a hatred for Chipotle, even though you used to like it.

Your friends keep trying to get you to go to Chipotle, but you say you're not a fan anymore.

Your friends are always surprised . "Really!?" They exclaim. "But it's so good, are you sure?"

Yes, you're sure. You've been sure ever since that day, years ago, when you smelled that vile ass odor.

Count Chocula whips his dick out,  it's massive girth beyond any you'd expect outside 373227. Even Tony couldn't  compare to this slippery scepter of semen secretion before you.

He shoves his massive all man meatsickle down most of your mouth, you gasp for breath, but breathing isn't a listed ingredient of this breakfast bangfest. 

You moan in delight, as count chocula grips your hair and uses your thrussy to selfishly pleasure his peen. There's nothing you can do but submit and enjoy him jackhammering his massive dick into your mouth, until you feel it pulsating from teeth to tonsils, caressing his heartbeat with your tongue.

Suddenly, his jism generator does just that, erupting his spooky-fun flavor into your mouth. As it drips down your chest, you realize he prefers his cereal with creamer.

Fry from Futurama walked out of the store, holding a plastic bag that wriggled in his fingers. He grinned as the stink lizards crawled on top of one another, making the bag wriggle.

"Gosh, I sure hope Inc likes these" he said to himself. Excitedly walking back to planet express with his valentines day gift.

Inc, short for Incidental 3, had just moved to New York from his home town of bikini bottom.

He still remembered the day he was ordering from his favorite restaurant (the krabby patty) and he felt funny. He had been day drinking earlier, and took a wrong turn to use the bathroom. As he walked down the hallway, he opened what seemed like the bathroom door, but the cold dark room soon alerted him to it being a freezer. Next thing he knew, he walked back into a bikini bottom of chrome and clones, nothing like what he remembered.

Overall, he still missed the patties, but he had found something special here.


"I'm back!" Fry said, opening the door. Inc jumped up excitedly, wrapping his fins around Fry and kissing his cheek.

"Happy Valentines day, love" Inc said, losing himself in the attractive redhead's eyes for a moment that went for an eternity, like a roller coaster ride the attendant forgot to turn off and you're on your second ride, happy you got to go again, but before your third ride, when the fear creeps in.

"So, uh, I wanted to make today special, so I got you a present" Fry said, handing him the squirming bag of stink lizards. "I wasn't sure if you'd like a bird or stink lizards, but the lizards reminded me of you." Fry said, blushing as he rubbed the back of his neck.

"Gee, thanks!" Inc said, taking the stink lizards. "I'll be sure to take good care of Incidental 223 to 323"

As he turned to take them to his room, Zoidberg walked into the room. "What's this?" He said, bumping into Inc, knocking the lizards from his hand. Immediately, they start scattering. Zoidberg grabs a handful and shoves them into his mouth.

"Oh no you don't!" Fry shouts, picking up a broom and hitting Zoidberg over the head with it, then forcing his mouth open to remove the stink lizards.

After that incident, Inc and Fry went back to lnc's house to set up the terrarium. After setting up up, the two grabbed a slurm from the fridge and sat on the balcony.

"You know, when I first got here, I was scared" Fry said. "I felt like a real fish out of water. And, well, you are one. It seems like we're made for each other.

Inc set a fin on Fry's hand. "You know, before you, nobody ever seemed to listen to me. In fact, I don't speak to anyone." He said.

"Well, I like listening to you." Fry set down his slurm and put his other hand on Inc's fin."

Inc pulled his red shirt off, laying back on the bed. His perfect abs and felt like a washboard as he ran his fins across them.

Fry hurriedly pulled his pants down, running over to the bed. "You know, I'm really glad you have the fish part on the top and the boy part on the bottom." Fry said, before ripping his shirt off and jumping on to the mattress. Fry pressed his tongue deep inside the sexy fish's throat, as if he was trying to get a taste of any krabby that might remain, but it was mostly slurm and stink lizard in there.

He reached his hand down and ran his hand down Inc's abs, running his fingernails lightly along his skin.

Inc moaned in delight, bucking his hips as his hardened cock lifted into the air like Christ on the third day.

"That's right" Fry said seductively, placing his hand on his big blue cock. "Hold on, I got just the thing." Fry said, as he poured some condensed slurm into his hand, and worked it into Inc's dick, stroking faster now.

The energy from the slurm only made Inc's massive erection more powerful, as he fucked StudBob Stuffedpants's magic hands (not as magic as when he had the robot devil's hands, but actually close).

Inc looked down, seeing Fry's own cock was throbbing hard, curving up, as it did when engorged.

Fry slowly pressed it unto Inc, as he moaned out in pain and pleasure. Continuing to jerk him off, Fry began slow fucking the aquatic creature, his green legs bouncing in the air.

"How's that baby?" Fry said "You like that don't you bitch?" Inc moaned out "Yes sir, it feels so *good*"

Fry picked up the pace, railing that tight fishussy like it was happy hour at a sushi bar. He felt his hard cock ready to burst, and he ejected a planet express size load into his asshole.

Inc's bucket finally released it's chum, shooting a huge load all over his perfect cum gutters.

As Fry pulled his dick out, he stopped to admire his masterpiece of a creampie. His thick, potent load sticking to the walls of Inc's perfect, used hole.

"How's my goatse looking senpai?" Inc said.

He chuckles "Well, it used to be a virgin asshole, but time makes fools of us all".

Zipp watches the reader metaphorically shit their pants from awesomeness, sliding the roster back on to the silver platter. “Ummmmmm, yeah, the boss said that the bus is, like, an elimination challenge game. You know, like the big brother show or something.” It becomes evident that Zipp doesn't know what he's talking about, likely because he hails from the misty memories of MTV being mostly music and not a multitude of reality television torture nexii.

“Anyway, uhh, bone apple teats!” he rolls away, far beyond the sight-lines of mortal eyes, returning to the collective dreams of humanity where all heroes go to die: on the fields of Nelvana.

Far beyond Nelvana, Michel Foucault sat on the balcony, cool air rushing along his scalp with the aerodynamics of a lobster if it was a bullet.The empty streets sped swiftly subordinate to his feet. He crossed his legs, trouser wool brushing against itself and upsetting the plaid geometries with the grace of  a tackily-dressed Cthulhu upending all of R’ylyeh to install shag carpet. The gaunt gloomy gloaming gushed into glittering galaxies of gaslamps as they approached the city. He took a drag off his cigarette with his head held high, neck constricting in his turtleneck as he breathed out a smooth cloud of cancero-cumulus that washed over the city below him like mana-boro from heaven. 

“You enjoying yourself?” Jax said, his smile unmoving as his wide square pupils set themselves on the philosopher.

Foucault blew his next cloud in Jax’s face.

The rabbit leaned on his knees, coughing as his pupils narrowed. A flash of anger appeared before being washed over with his normal smug demeanor. “Jeez baldy…haha, what's your problem?” he asked, leaning on the balcony. The cool air pulled his ears back as lonely street lights gradually coalesced into the gradient of a golden city around them. 

Foucault waved his fingers through his own dragon's breath, weaving tides of nicotine into ether that disintegrated against Jax’s concrete smile like foam on breakers.

“I’m just thinking, Jaques—and you make it extraordinarily difficult sometimes—about the notion of power exertions originating in social institutions…” 

Jax winced, raising his gloves to level his hands before Michel. “Okay, first off don't make my name sound so… what's the word… disgusting. Second, power is just the law of the jungle, cueball.” He said this last word by touching his finger to Foucault's head as if pointing to an island on a globe.

Michel’s eyes narrowed as he connected his tan and brown loafer with Jax’s stomach, sending Jax flying into the chair across from him. He caressed his pipe as he exhaled a barrage of jellyfish puffs into the air. They were now deep in the city, lights so pretty contrasting the night as if sitting in many quaint and curious shades of forgotten noir. “Well my dear imitation Bugs Bunny, power is indeed the law of the jungle… as I believe it is in the university. It seems to me the theory of power/knowledge are ultimately identical, since at the end of the eighteenth century institutions have used scientific understanding to define truth and exert dominance.”

Jax’s eyes shrink unconsciously, then he subtly shakes his head and they enlarge again. “Oh, you want to talk about power? Like the people who control the world know what they're doing? You think anyone knows what's going on? Listen, you and me are just playthings at the hands of some moron who's afraid of the word ‘&$#!’”

Foucault tilted his head and grimaced. “The Français word for seal?”༎ ༎

༄༅། །Bracketed Sites: The climb to the caverns of contra-cis[]crip contemplation

Special Thanks (in no particular order): Lunnaroz, blooj, AHugeHildaFan, and Marharth



Squidward squiddled his way up the mountain, his feet shriveled from the continuous puckering of his suction cups against the rocky terrain. His tongue and skin were still a deep plaid from his earlier mishap: falling into a vat of pretty patty sauce, eating it all, the plaid going to his thighs, then him exploding such that:

P(Gφ→FPNφ→EPNφ→TNφ→Ex)

He thought about that recent memory bitterly. Although it was only minutes ago it felt like yesterday. In those days, in those distant days. In those nights, in those far-off nights. As Gilgames𒎌 was unable to unenshare man from mortality, neither could Squidward free himself from his pillory of plaid punishment.

As he sat in the vat, he had a spat with a man in a hat who sat and asked him to chat with his cast. The man who appeared instantly in front of him had no head, just large teeth with eyes floating within. “Hello my putty angel with a silver smile, my name is Caine, and I need your help with 𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝔸𝕞𝕒𝕫𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝔻𝕚𝕘𝕚𝕥𝕒𝕝 ℂ𝕚𝕣𝕔𝕦𝕤 in this cave. Just hike up this mountain trail in Southern California and await further instructions from THE COUNCIL.” The lighting dramatically charged around him as he said this. Cain pointed dramatically into the sky as the lighting struck, the air pregnant with awkward silence as he looked back behind him.”Oh…usually by now Bubble says something totally uncalled for!” a bubble appeared by him with large teeth “Maan f*$!k the council!”

“Bubble, you can't keep swearing!” Caine yelled.

“Yes, scream for daddy.” 

Caine raises his hands and huffs “Bubble stop it!” He turned to Squidward quickly “Sorry for that RUDE bubble, Squidward. Anyway, best of luck on your quest!” He said before flying into space. The memory still lingered in Squidward's mind as he walked up the increasingly steep mountain trail.

As the hike up the Etiwanda hill trailhead chipped away at his stamina, Squidward took a brief respite, letting the mountain air smooth his burning lungs. It was one thing to be hiking on his own, and another entirely to be a sea creature on land making this journey. He pulled a brass telescope from his bag, looking down at the city of Rancho Cucamonga. 

His vision blurred, sharpening into focus as he saw the familiar lines of antlers sharpen. The front of the building said “Bass Pro Shop: Home to Hunters, Fishers, and other kinds of Liars.” 
 
He saw two men exiting the store, associates carrying out a large hot tub. The first man had wavy white hair and a charming, fangy smile. The second was a bit more bashful, wearing a cloak and sporting a dashing brown beard and long, thick hair that swept down his neck like murky mysterious waterfalls.

“Hmmmph, Astarion/Gale getting another hot tub it seems…” he said, imagining his own steamy night of passion with his lovers (Boris Yeltsin and Geordi LaForge, naturally) their bodies tying in tantric tessellations like the two that telescopically tantalized him down below. 



He sighed deeply before continuing his journey.

He huffed as his hike had him heaving with heavy steps, until he finally reached the foot of the cave. As he entered the stone-womb, he heard the mirthful laughing of many inside. They turned to greet him.

The trans[]crip council were as joyous as they were powerful, their blue bodies emanating the highest magnitude of transgender crippled aura in aquamarine hues like summer skies and ocean reefs. They were vedas with two juggernaut wheels; guardians to the keys to the akashic records of a new theory of being on the intersections of transness and (dis)ability. 



Jax sat with the council, criss cross applesauce on the floor like the whiny fucking baby he was. He looked up at Squidward with a smug little grin. “Hey Squids, me and the council were just playing mahjong but I don't get it.” And he threw them at Squidward. Just fucking threw them.

   🀁         🀃🀆
🐇 🀀   🀂    🀃
        🀄 🀁      🀈  🀋 💢🦑 
    🀅   🀀
👩🏽‍🦽👩🏽‍🦼👨🏼‍🦽🧑🏽‍🦼🧑‍🦼

The tiles pinged off Squidward’s head and fell to the ground, tikatakakakatakit.

“Ugh, Jax is tormenting the NPCs again.” Zooble said, rolling their eyes and talking to no one in particular.

A member of the council with a white tutu and no ear waved their hand, the tiles hovering and hanging with holy halo halations, then hazy in their homecoming to the realm of forms as the ideal mah-jong tiles. 

“Enough” they boomed. “We are all here today to discuss the findings of Tertön I.M. Meen…” as the council rolled their wheelchairs back, the horrid wizard man danced forwards, his suspenders falling as we walked towards Squidward and the Amazing Digital circus crew. 

“Big old scary bathroom, see them shudder, watch them squirm. How I H̶̨̝̱̠̬̦͂̾͐̾̓̔̈́̓͝͠A̶̢̬̪͔̞̱͓̜̘̺̅͛̾̓̉͑͘͘͠T̵̠̲͈̤̙̱͉̩̘̻̼̈́̿E̸͍̿̈́ populist nationalism, how it makes my stomach churn!” I.M. Meen delivered in song.

He opened his book, and the pages turned seemingly on their own. A structure emerged from the tome, familiar pictograms of a man and woman on triangular and circular placards respectively emerging from the pages like bamboo shoots from Arashiyama. As the structure expanded, stones began flipping on the cave, some lifting from the ground. With each flip, the stones became shinier, taking on navy blue or white color. As the mah-jong tiles had left, now wall tiles were appearing. Sinks followed, then stalls as the platonic ideal of a bathroom now made up the cave. 

The council member with the beard spoke “Bathrooms are the ontological Nexus of the trans debate; the mount Meru of trans discourse in the public space. This is the place where the peaks of race, ability, and gender collide, the Chushi Gangdruk of discourse emanating from here to the intellectual valleys of Twitter and Gavin Newsom's bitch mouth.

As disabled people, we often find ourselves deemed unworthy of gender by society, relegated to bathrooms that have conveniently been ungendered in ways the culture war seems to ignore. 

In this way, our disability separates us from the gender binary—and by extension—excommunicates us from binary bathrooms.”

The slender council member with hoop earrings continues. 

“Race also plays a role in who is awarded gender recognition in this space. Many bathrooms in the South would be marked “Women's”, “Mens”, or “Colored”. Now, if gendered bathrooms are so important for traditional values, why were gendered bathrooms not deemed important for people of color or disabled people? Isn't it interesting how people of color are not only robbed of their humanity in this society, but also more likely to be diagnosed with disability?”

The council member with the longer perm continued “How many marginalized people do you think were integral to scientific progress as creators and as testees, but were never credited for their contributions? The examples are countless, and among those people are crips that the cis and abled sought to “cure”.

The idea of a “cure” deeply affects trans and disabled people. It is a binary concept that offers little room for complexity or variation from a perceived “norm” that smooths over a reality too abrasive for the hegemonic Tlön being built before us. 

dis/abled bodies are viewed as oppositional as new binaries are built brick by brick.”

Tertön I.M. Meen continues “Trans and disabled intersectional experiences are rarely disc̴͇͐u̸̩͆͝s̴͈̎͆s̷̞̗͊ed in writing, which is why this word was made! Trans[]crip is a word that helps us fill those brackets with all the many b̴̹̝͉̜̈́ỳ̴̦̩̭̿̄ways where we experience joy, suffering, violence, aspiration, theory, and topographical symbols.” He continues, ripping his shirt to show off his top scars radiating with purple patterns.

Everyone clapped. Except Jax. Jax had fallen asleep.

Pomni looked up at I.M. Meen “How did you pronounce the brackets?”

“What?”

“You said trans[]crip” Pomni said

“...How did I say that? Shouldn't that sound like trans crip?” she shook her head and looked down at the tile floor, bathed in silence.

“I don't know what you mean, Pomni. You just said trans[]crip twice.” He finally said. 

Zooble looked up “So is this different from saying trans* or trans-?”

Gangle looked at her zoobled companion, shaking her head “How is that possible?”

Jax sat up, smiling “It's possible—Right Pomni?”

Pomni rolled her eyes and looked away.

Jax looked around at the sink behind them and the stalls in front of them, then back down at the tile he rested on. 

“...am I laying on the bathroom floor?”

“... it's possible.”

“Shut up, Pomni.”

༎ ༎


༈ “So what's the difference between trans*, trans-, and trans[]crip?” Zoobled reiterated

I.M. Meen continued in his high-pitched, nasally voice “Well bookworm, trans- refers to a Ṣ̵̼̫̗̩͍͍͐̓͝T̷̢̡̝̜̳̳̽̓̿A̷̧͔̩̞̞̲͊̾T̷̘̔̃͝Ë̶̺̰̲̠̩́̈́̊͑̌͆͝ of change. This is the original usage in Latin, and differs from the modern use of T̸̥͝R̵̰̪̚A̴̠̋̏Ñ̸̗̅Ṣ̸̪͛̓͒ as a noun. Like the phrase ‘trans studies’.

The asterisk in trans* is meant to mark something we cannot name or know. It's a magic laboratory where we can change the way things go.

But trans[]crip brings balance to the trans and crip worlds. It's like having them both share an asterisk with curls.” 

Zoobled nodded “Oh I see. It's kind of like being trans can change how you experience disability, and disability can change how you experience transness. So this book you found is meant to examine that space where the experiences collide?”

I.M. Meen nodded, pulling a flower from his jacket “Precisely, bookworm. That space is your own personal microwave and you can S̸̢̭̼͍̙͈̚͜ͅH̵͍̰͋̂̑̎̊̿͂̑͌̈͜Ǫ̸̨̞̫̫͇̫̦̆̓̈́̀̑ͅV̷̨̹̮̦̼̻̈́̔Ę̵̱̹̹͗̊̅̈́͑͒̽̇̄̀͝ whatever you like inside! Have fun!” He said laughing as he placed the flower on his lapel before removing it again (why does he do that?) then disappeared into a shimmering of ephemeral sparkles and clouds, only his eyes remaining briefly before popping out of existence.”

Jax looked at where I.M. Meen was. “This adventure is weird…I don't like it.”

Zoobled looked over at Jax “Actually, this is one I put in the suggestion box.” They say.

“What? Why?” 

“Well…I didn't choose that guy, or this adventure exactly, but I asked to learn more about what it means to be me, and why I’m like…this” Zoobled continues, looking down at their hand. 

Ragatha put her hand on Zooble’s shoulder “Hey that's nice Zooble, now we can all learn more about what it means to be you.”

The convoluted shape-beast nodded “Yeah, it was actually…pretty sweet of Cain to put this together.”

Jax’s eyes narrow, his mouth clenching on one side. “Okay I vote we skip this one.” Jax said, his declaration followed with silence. He looked down at where the voting screen usually is. “Hey, what gives!?” He said.

“Yeah, we don't vote for this one. Cain thought it was important we learn about this.” Zooble said. 

Jax rolled his eyes and put his hands behind his head. “Whaatever, I'll be over here, on the cool kids side of the bathroom.” He stood up and walked to the corner nearest the sinks, his bushy tail waving by Pomni.

Kinger poked his head out of the toilet and looked at the rest of the digital circus “I’m…barely in this chapter, aren’t I?” 
༎ ༎


༈The tiles in the bathroom spun again, slowly returning to their spelunkenly rocky textures and dark earth tones.

The council remained, the one with the hoop earrings speaking. “Another thing about the word trans[]crip is how it forms an avatar for testing far beyond the boundaries of intersectionality or integration. 

Like how transness is seen as a form of madness, but to actually be trans and mad is different. Despite these ideas being distinct, they are still experienced in a single stream of consciousness. 

Kinger, head shoved into a toilet, raised a finger “Oh I see, so that’s where the brackets come in again. It’s kind of like you can explain there is a relation without losing the distinctness of either…madness doesn’t necessarily need a cure, and neither does being different in other ways. Maybe, we just need to be there for each other, instead of trying to fix each other.”

The council member nodded “That’s brilliant, Kinger. The psychological challenges that emanate from gender dysphoria can be just as debilitating as other mental disabilities, which will naturally meet in the brackets of trans[]crip, and don’t necessarily need to be cured.”

A cool summer afternoon, a nice crossbreeze brings some fresh air into the living room. 

"I'm n-not even sure wh-what I want to do" Says Scatman John. " I j-just keep fi-fiddling with my hhat" he laughs, setting it on the coffee table to his side.

"Well, how about I get us something to eat and you two get to know each other?" Julie says, leaving the room.

Scatman John still doesn't really know the young boy to his left, but decides to fix that. "S-so wo-would you like to sing a song?" He asks. 

As the boy sheepishly nods, he feels something change. The world vibrating around him like a bus, the colors become more vibrant, more pure. 

"When you choose the Scat man,
  you know you can't be losing.

As long as peace is the dream that you are a choosing. 

Love for your brothers and your sisters, boys and girls.

Is how we come together to make a scatland world."

Scatman begins scatting with the intensity of the death waltz, absolutely blowing the boy's mind. With a gleam in his eye, he begins the next verse, and with that they find themselves in giant bubbles flying over San Francisco, a parade of children beneath them.

"We're reaching a new time line.

love will be the prime time

so if you get in my line

I know you'll have a fine time.

Scat is the music of the children

make them free.

All you need is music, the hope and belief."

The chorus begins, the parade is in full swing, moving from downtown to the beach. Dolphins have been spotted nearby off the coast.

"Scatland is our dream.

It can be reality.

Just take my hand.

And we'll make it just believe."

With those magic words fireworks begin, the jazz band is in full swing and Scatman John begins dancing with the drill team. The boy is in shock.

As the world returns to normal, Scatman laughs "S-so did you like s-singing that song with me?" The boy nods.

"Yes, but can I ask a question?" He says a bit sheepish.

"Sure, ask away!"

" Well, can we really make a scatland for everyone, where people from all around the globe are welcome?"

" Absolutely kid, you just gotta believe!" He says beaming.

"I do. I dream just like you scatman. A free, open society for all the people of the world. I promise I'll make it happen."

The two embrace, and the young boy walks to the door.

" W-wait kid, what's your name?" Scatman John asks.

He looks back. "My name is George Soros."

As George left, Julie returned. "Where did the boy go?" 

"Oh h-he's on to bigger and better things I think." Scatman said.

"Ah, well we have some new visitors today. I'm not sure how long they'll be staying."

"W-well we never really know. The things we call gone haven't yet had the chance to arrive."

"True. Well I got a new game for us to try today. It's like grand theft auto, but in space? Also brownies are done."

Julie sets up the console, handing Scatman John a controller.

Omar and Angel enter the house, the two mice furries looking around. "Not a bad place to stop" Omar ⁸says, ready to sulk.

"Oh stop Omar, it's better than our dump in Ohmtown." She holds his arm and his sulk softens. "Alright alright, well let's introduce ourselves to our hostess."

Omar bows mock regally to Julie, who curtsies in response before giggling. " My name is Omar, this is Angel. We're musicians from Ohmtown, if you haven't heard."

"Oh I have. I was impressed for sure. by your teamwork in stopping Mok."

" Yeah, our album's not too bad eithe-" Angel elbows the wind out of Omar before he can finish.

"What he means to say is that it was our duty, but thank you."

"Would either of you like some lemonade or brownies? We're about to play Republican Space Rangers."

Omar shrinks back, "No thanks, I've had enough brainwashing for a lifetime."

Scatman turns around " D-did you folks say you do music? I happen to be a sensation in Germany and Japan." 

Angel looks confused " Are those pre war places? I haven't heard those names before. "

"P-pre war??"

"Nothing to worry about Scatman" Julie reassures him. 

He shrugs it off " Well, either way, would you like to h-have a jam session? I have a small studio in my room here, 17th floor. Ill show you if you like. 

"Sure we'd love to." Omar says

"*I* would love to" Angel corrects him

The three go up the elevator to their room.

"Oh well, guess I'll play myself." Julie says, starting up the game.

"You got another controller?" A deep voice suggesting a baritone lounge singer says. Julie turns around to see Larry Quinn, the fiendishly handsome man who tormented Conrad and tried to seduce away his mom's fortune, until he was thwarted by him and the cat in the hat.

 "Sure" Julie says unsure, before handing him one.

The two made characters, Julie looking like a facsimile of herself, Larry picking a character closer to Kang and Kodos Johnson, the aliens from the Simpsons (who by coincidence live in the illustrious and esoteric attic dimension of the place everyone can call home).

Julie begins her session by driving a hoverbike through the window of a well to do family, destroying their kitchen ware.

Larry follows her on his hoverbike, zigzagging around the family's remaining furniture.

"This game looks incredible!" Larry says, laughing a deep hearty laugh.

"Yeah I guess." Julie says dismissively.

Larry looks uncomfortable. "You know, I'm sorry about what I did to the Waldons. I've come to terms with that." He begins.

"Did you tell the Waldens that?" Julie asks.

"I have, I've wished them well. I left Anville for a new start, something I thought you'd know by my moving here." Larry says.

"You seemed irredeemable to me honestly. How do I know?"

Julie flies through the other side of the house, a cascade of glass reflecting the police lights behind her. Larry is flying alongside her now, trying to maintain the conversation.

"You don't know, would you rather take the chance of being fooled by a monster, or denying the power of self transformation to a changed man?"

Julie paused to think, as she barrel rolled to avoid police fire. "Fair point. I think a rule Utilitarian would be obligated to accept your change until proven otherwise, since we can't have a society where we never forgive. That being said, being a two level utilitarian I'll examine your actions from an act utilitarian perspective when I have the time." Julie turns on her bike and fires into a police car, crashing it.

"Well, judging by consequentialist standards I failed regardless, really I'm most heinous in terms of my deontology, and in actor targeted virtue ethics." Larry says as he swerves around police laser shots, flying over a balcony and narrowly avoiding a clothesline, blue boxers sticking to his face. He pulls them off and flies back to Julie.

"Maybe, my friend Zephyr suggested I rely on more than consequentialism, but that seems like sloppy philosophy more than a real system."

Larry laughs. "We're dealing with alot of oughts here, take a step back and ask if that consistency is as important as condemning me. So far, I think my multi faceted ethics is harsher on me than you are."

Julie swerves to face Larry, cutting him off. "No that's actually a good point. What have you done to change your impact on the world, via felicific calculus?" 

"I volunteer for a suicide hotline every night now, after I lost my beer gut I became a big brother also."

Julie sits impressed, not noticing the police fire shooting her out of the sky. She dies in game, and Larry drives away.

"I have to admit, you're a better person than me Larry. At least, as much as 'people' exist.".

"I really appreciate that Julie. I think you'd make a great big sister for a child in need. Consider it. I'm going to play this for awhile more. Did you know you can be a defense lawyer for space immigrants in this game?"

The doorbell rings and Julie opens it, an alien family walks in and the mom uses her tentacle and slaps her in the face. "Thanks for wrecking my table asshole".

"You know I never got how some people hate the instrument set up. I mean, I've been playing piano for decades and I know it's hard, but that's just another part of the song to me." Said Scatman casually, tuning his piano while Omar turned the strings on his guitar, playing each string as they shifted into tune. "Yeah, I can find it relaxing, but it can be real annoying to retune my guitar for each song. I don't want to be lazy and write them all in the same key, you know?"

"Wouldn't know, I've always been a piano guy." With a quick partnering of scratching and bumping noises, Scatman moved the last bit of equipment into place "...Well, I'm done. Mind if I just play something and we go from there?" Omar nodded and Scatman went off, improvising melodies in with so many key changes it looked like his hands were shuffling the keys of the piano.

Omar joined in showily, providing rhythm and feeling out the song that was forming. Angel provided a keytar melody, everything coming together nicely. Angel and Omar harmonized as Scatman began adding percussive scat beats to ground the song.

As they did this, the lights of the room dimmed, and a red vortex appeared outside. Angel and Omar stopped scared, Scatman still caught up for a few extra moments to scat eyes closed, before reading the room and looking outside with horror. The vortex was pulsating as the earth around it became barren. "That's definitely not Scatland." he murmured.

A large hand appears out of the portal, grabbing the edge. A shockwave came from the ground at that moment, and up came a hulking man in a torn military uniform with a metal implant on his chest that glowed faintly red. He reared back with a war cry, before looking down at his hands. "I'm alive! Wait, didn't Jax?.." He trailed off in self thought, removing his green officer's cap to wipe sweat from his brow. He looked around and started making way to the house.

Julie heard a ring at the doorbell, and opened it to see a massive figure taking up the doorframe. "Hello. I seem to be...lost. And alive. This is a strange day for me. Can you please direct me to a portal to Outworld?"

Julie looked perplexed. "Wait, are you Hsu Hao? I don't have a room ready for you, but feel free to get acquainted with some other guests. You should be able to return home by walking towards the sunset later today."

"How? Is this Outworld?"

"Noo, of course not." Julie said laughing. " We don't have quite enough dead bodies or kung fu despots to be outworld. Plus did you see my lawn?"

Hsu Hao nodded. Her lawn did indeed have big Edenia energy.

"Alright, well can it be sooner? I have places to be."

"Afraid not, sunsets were the best narrative device I could come up with for interdimensional travel. But don't worry, a lifetime here is as long as the blink of an eye most worlds. Returning will be so fast you'll likely wonder if this was a hallucination, if that. There's a guest room behind you by the front door. You can rest before you leave."

"Hmm. I see." Hsu Hao opened up his watch, holograms appearing above his wrist but glitching. "Damn no signal" he said, stomping his foot on the floor. Julie was afraid a floorboard might come loose.

Scatman, Omar, and Angel run down from their room. Omar looks pissed "Look are you some kind of demon!? We'll send you back if we have to!" 

Hsu Hao laughs and pushes him over. "Demon is too perfect a word for me boy." Omar smirks and holds his hands up in mock cowardice "OhH, i'M sCaReD. Please don't huurt me!". Angel and Scatman rush to pick Omar up as he brushes them off. "H-hey things don't have to be like this. C-calm down buddy." Scatman offers. Hsu Hao walks into his room.

"What a dick." Omar says, spitting. Angel pats his back and offers words of encouragement while Scatman grimaces.

"Be careful Omar. That could have gone a lot worse!" Angel says to Omar.

"Yeah well anything that comes out of a portal, I have trouble trusting." Omar says. 

"S-So when you two sing together, you summon demons?" Scatman asks.

"Well, last time it sent a demon back, so I'm not sure."

"W-well, maybe your voices combined with Scatland and summoned that guy? It seems reasonable."

Angel pushes past Omar and runs upstairs.

Omar looks back at her baffled. "What's gotten into her now?" He wonders out loud.

"Well, I did notice when we were playing it seemed like she wanted a solo. " Scatman offers.

"... No, we've been over that. " Omar casts his hand as if to shoo the idea away.

"I don't know everything about girl problems, but I do know improv when I hear it.. I just think we all have a voice in this world, and sometimes it needs a chance to be set free. "

Omar flinches. Things felt more right to him when he was exorcising demons in Nuke York.

"I dunno.."


"We c-can talk about that later. Let's get Angel and fix this!" 

Chapter 4

Hsu Hao set his officer's hat on the night stand and flopped into the bed made for him. 

While it wasn't as good as his quarters in Outworld, it was certainly better than the last few nights he spent rough sleeping on his hunt for Jax.

"Not even a hallucination.." He muttered to himself, feeling the soft linen and silk of his bedsheets. He'd experienced stranger things in his life. 

Not quite as strange as the giant rodent he had just strangled (or...feline? It's hard to tell exactly. Nonetheless weird as fuck.)

Hsu Hao didn't much believe in fate, but upon reflection he thought it was extremely coincidental that he heard that same creature from earlier outside.

"Okay let's hurry and just do what we did before." Omar says loudly. 

"Wait, we were supposed to try this without both of us!" Angel says, her voice sharpened.

Ignoring her, Omar bursts into song, strumming an acoustic guitar. Angel sighs and joins in. The two launch off on an acoustic, but nonetheless powerful rock opera.

Immediately Hsu Hao opens his door open, knocking it off it's hinges, and looks down with his eyes barely open.

Omar gives a thumbs up, more cocky than usual, but as he turns Hsu Hao uppercuts him into the ceiling, his head taking residence among the light fixtures.

Angel shrieks, and Hsu Hao cracks his knuckles before approaching her. "You really should have let me sleep." He says.

Angel takes a step back, and begins singing. Hsu Hao's hand immediately disappears in a red glow, as his foot follows. 

As he's reduced to a head, Angel finishes her first verse, and he goes away.

Scatman pulls Omar's foot, and he falls from the ceiling, crashing to the floor, cursing as dust gets into his eyes.

"Wow, all this time and angel alone was the trick!" Scatman said.

"I love it when someone uses their own voice, and who knew we could even stop something like that!"

Angel, with her arms crossed, walks to Omar. "Looks like you owe someone an apology." 

"Yeah, I guess I paid for that one. Nothing to say we can't split out songs 50/50." Omar says, getting up and holding his jaw.

"Maybe a bit more, it hurts to talk." 

"Well I'm just glad you're okay. Let's get that iced." The two walk Omar to the kitchen, tending to his bruises.

Chapter 5

"D-did we do it?" Omar asked, shocked.

"I don't know, but I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of him" Angel said. 

"W-well, it seems to me we got everything fixed, no harm no foul." Scatman says with a smile built of satisfaction.

"..I take it we can't play together then. That blows." Omar says, putting his hands behind his head and leaning against a wall. This leaves Scatman feeling a bit warm. "I'm sure we can try again outside or something. Maybe even bring someone to help in case it happens again." Scatman offers, cocking his head and raising an eyebrow in anticipation.

"...not this time Paul, not singing anyway. I still owe Angel her song, I think."

Squidward squiddled his lips into Boris Yeltsin’s mouth,in tandem teasing and testing the glasnost of his goatse. He docked his squocky squid suction squock deep in the dangling dong we call the Yeltsin cock. 

Boris Yeltsin screamed with surprise, an iceberg of pain that carried a vast expanse of pleasure beneath the surface. 

His head reared back, his Russian dick experiencing a shock therapy that could ravish the Russian Federation if he didn't already fuck that up entirely. 

Squidward did one of his signature chuckles hearing his moans, and he slowly pushed the whole of his fist into Yeltsin's ever-expanding dong.

“It appears I'm late to this party” Geordi LaForge said, slipping out of his yellow uniform and attaching his cock to Yeltsin's ass like a male anglerfish on a fertile female.

He pumped in and out, Geordi’s visor picking up the countless hedons radiating from the former president’s full head of cocaine-white hair. He often wondered if the ample expanse atop his head had any dandruff. If it did, would he know? It was impossible to tell; he might as well have been a starving bat looking for peppered moths in Victorian Europe. He might as well have been a hog scanning the forest bushes for tigers. He might as well have been a techbro trying to look out for NFT scams. 

He reached out to pat Yeltsin's head as he went inside him, hoping to feel out any potential dandruff, but his hand slid across his full head like a Chinchilla's coat. Soft, gliding smoothness met his hands.  

He realized again what he had learned through years of being in this committed polycule: Boris was an honest man, completely upstanding when he wasn't bending him over the counter of an abandoned K-Mart camera film kiosk.

“Oh God, Geordie! Deeper please!” He screamed out. Geordie smirked, reaming his ass at warp speed. Every pump brought Boris closer to climax.

Squidward started rapidly pounding the Yeltrethra (Yeltsin Urethra) with his fist. He played his cock like a clarinet solo. 

As the two hit him from either side, his cock and ass were finally on the free market, but his lovers were fully commanding this economy.

Squidward suddenly pulled his fist from Yeltsin's cock, and inserted his own. LaForge and Squidward slammed into Yeltsin back-and-forth like a pushcart on a train track taking a long hard trip to pleasure station.

Suddenly, Squidward reached down and grabbed his own dick, twisting slow and hard. Geordi watched the skin twist until the wrinkles became thick spirals, then pulled quickly until his cock detached from his own body and stuck inside Yeltsin's own.

The two shrieked with pleasure as squidward's blood and cum formed an elixir of pleasure deep in the athanor called the Yeltrethra (Yeltsin Urethra). 

Boris felt a deep rumbling within him, then he suddenly erupted. Collossal chunks of cum collided and covered his carnal comrades. Geordi’s sensors immediately pinged, his visor rapidly pulsating red LEDs as his own cock began throbbing and he let out a low growl.

The three felt their cocks harmonize in a divine choir that made the angels cry with awe and envy. The tryptich of thick tips touched with tugs, thrusts, and twist-tricks. Euterpe smiled down on their performance, a ballad of butt-blasting beyond her blessing.

The three sat in bed and lit some weed cigarettes to celebrate their moment of primal bliss. 

“That was incredible.” Geordie was the first to say. “My sensors indicate our hedons were off the charts. Nearly 50 Bentham-Watts of pleasuremaxxing.”

Boris nodded “It sure was something….” he sighed and looked away wistfully.

“What is it?” Squidward asked, smiling weakly. “You know, usually I'm the sourpuss.”

“Oh, it's not you two.” Yeltsin said “it's just…I wish I brought that kind of pleasure to the Russian people.”

Geordie nodded “But not sexually right?”

“No no. Of course not.” He clarified.

Squidward looked up “Wait, there were old ladies and stuff. They couldn't ALL consent to that.”

“Yes I just said no Squidward.” Boris said sharply. “You know I'm a consent king. Or president but you know. I like democracy as much as I like bottoming for you two.”

“right right.”

He sighed “anyway..I mean. Our nation had such a long history. Proud but…brutal at times. I was hoping we could usher in a new era of democracy but…well I suppose that's not what fate had in mind. The wheel of fortune spun on Soviet tank treads, trampling my hopes for a better tomorrow.”

Squidward nodded, and slowly put his hand on his shoulder. “Hey…that's not entirely true.”

Geordie smiled and put his arm around his shoulder. “Yeah, think about it. Before you, the Soviet Union was in deep economic disrepair. Shock therapy might have been a rocky fix, but it definitely beat the alternative. And one day, Earth will get rid of currency entirely. The Russian Federation will become THE federation. ..The whole planet will remember you fondly.” Geordie said.

Boris felt a smile pull at the corners of his mouth. “Awe, Geordie, thank you.” He said, pecking his cheek. “But the no currency thing is…really dumb.”

“Well you are just a Liberal in the end.” Squidward said with a warm smile. 

The three pulled the covers down, ready for round two.

A raven in a maroon banyon looked up from an old book in his study, opened his beak, and screamed.

"Theeee Eeeend!”

Bonzi T. Buddy was a bit nervous as he pushed open the smooth saloon doors. They felt like driftwood, and reminded him of his time catching waves on venice beach.

Given his current location, a musty, gator infested swamp, he'd rather stay inside. As he walked in, he saw many other apes, relaxing, throwing darts, and having long discussions about nothing that flowed deep into the night. 

Bonzi asked the bartender for a long island iced tea, nothing too strong.

As he made his order, someone sat closely beside him. "Two dragon's bloods, please." He said in a gruff voice, mumbling.

Bonzi turned to look at who was buying him a drink. He had a deep crimson, shiny fur, and a dagger between his teeth. 

He had a leather admiral's hat on his head, and a black turtle neck. His neck was shaved, and he had a multitude of eyes tattooed on him.

The ape playfully flicked the cross earring in his right ear, and said "Name's #7495, pleased to meet you".

"Hello there, I don't believe we've been properly introduced" Bonzi says, running his finger along his drink. "I'm Bonzi."

"Ah, Bonzi." #7495 says. "Most apes have a four digit name here, and aren't as lively as you seem to be." He says.

"Can I be honest with you, Bonzi?" #7495 says.

"Absolutely" Bonzi says

"I find this place a bit..boring. It's relaxing, but I want to make tonight something to remember. Want to follow me?"

Bonzi casts a playful eye up and down #7495's body. The turtleneck might be baggy, but his exposed legs and genitalia leave nothing to the imagination.

"Sure, let's go!"

The two walk to the back bathroom, through a cloud of cigarettes and noisy conversations.

#7495 immediately pushes Bonzi Buddy up against the wall, his mind wild with lust as he drops the dagger from his mouth and presses his tongue deep into Bonzi Buddy's throat.

The purple ape screeches with pleasure as he tears #7495's turtle neck from his body like trees from the rainforest floor burned to make him, and runs his hand down his ripped abs, resting them on his firm ass. His entire body is as covered in tattoos as it is muscles, and his throbbing cock has extended as fast and as tall as his own price on the Ethereum market.

Bonzi buddy leans down and slurps #7495's salty shaft like it's banana pudding, and as he does the red ape begins pounding down Bonzi's thrussy.

As he does this, he grows engorged in his throat, when suddenly #7495 pulls out. "Turn around" he doesn't ask, he demands, in his deep voice, now unmuffled, which only turns Bonzi on more. He turns around, placing his hands on the graffiti wall, as #7495 slams his shaft in and out of Bonzi's ass hole. 

He moans with pleasure as he feels the cock's force building up in him, until the red ape pumps his non fungible spunk into him, making it overflow and cover the floor with his love syrup.

The two's eyes lock as #7495 slowly pulls out, and Bonzi begins licking his lover's still long cock until it's sparkling clean.

The two go upstairs, resting in #7495's room overlooking the yacht club.

"You know, Bonz? I think we can make this work out." He says.

"Why's that?" He says

"You, some sexy trojan spywear, and me, an NFT. Between the two of us, we can sucker millions of tech bros. He says, caressing the purple ape's thigh."

"I love the way you think, let's see where our love takes us."
